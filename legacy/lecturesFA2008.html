<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2008</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">"At the Tone, the Time Will Be <u>Precisely.</u>.." (not)</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">If you find the change to Daylight Savings Time confusing and have
trouble with "30 days hath September...", you haven't seen anything
yet: Universal Coordinated Time, Sidereal Time, International
Atomic Time, leap seconds, Julian Date, Gregorian Calendar,
lunar year, Mayan Long Count... and don't forget relativistic time
dilation! In this talk we'll look at calendars and clock time, how
astronomy is intimately tied to both--and why things will *ALWAYS*
be a mess. </p>

<p class="title">Your place in the Universe</p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">Join our beautiful voyage around the place we call "home". If you think you know
 your neighborhood well, think again. This CAS lecture will explore the neighborhood around at which
 we live in. What kind of neighborhood are we living in? Know some of your neighbors: the hot young
 open cluster, the cool and old globular cluster, the devastating binary twins, all the way out to
 our nearest island galaxy: the Andromeda. The voyage will take you out further to the local group,
 virgo supercluster to the edge of the observable universe and our current understanding of the cosmos. </p>

<p class="title">The 10 Most EXTREME Sights in Naked-Eye Astronomy</p>
<p class="presenter">Brandon Aldinger</p>
<p class="abstract">Only the rarest, the most spectacular, the most bizarre astronomical
sights are worthy to be called EXTREME.  This talk takes a whirlwind tour
through 10 heavenly wonders, all visible without a telescope, complete
with tips to maximize your chances of seeing the extreme.  Ranging from
exploding space junk to the far-away edge of the universe, you'll learn
how naked-eye astronomy is much more exciting than just playing
constellation connect-the-dots. </p>

<p class="title">Light Fantastic<br />
or, A Guided Tour of the Electromagnetic Spectrum </p>
<p class="presenter">Anthony Milano</p>
<p class="abstract">The icon of the astronomer is the telescope, and rightfully so.
 From the illumination of the Moon to the whispers of the Big Bang itself, practically
 all our knowledge of the Cosmos comes from light in one of its many guises. And light
 does so much more for us! Come learn about the electromagnetic spectrum: its history,
 its manifold uses in the terrestrial realm, and its starring role in the heavens.  </p>

<p class="date">October 10</p>
<p class="title">Climate Catastrophes in the Solar System  </p>
<p class="presenter">
Dr. David Grinspoon, Curator of Astrobiology, Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science </p>
<p class="abstract">David Grinspoon will provide an interplanetary perspective on climate
change. What happened to the lost oceans of Venus and Mars? How did
these worlds go wrong, and could this happen to our planet? Venus,
Mars, and Saturn’s moon Titan each have complex climate systems, and
each has experienced radical climate changes. We will journey through
the solar system—and deep time—discovering runaway greenhouses,
snowball planets, and the long-term fate of Earth.  </p>

<p class="title"> An Introduction to the Science of the Early Universe </p>
<p class="presenter"> Samuel Johnson Stoever </p>
<p class="abstract">We all know that the famous Large Hadron Collider will be called upon
(when operational) to study, among other areas, conditions seen in the early universe.
But, what are these conditions? What was the early universe like, and what were the
intermediate stages between then and now? Perhaps most interestingly, how can astronomer
see what happened and how it looked? Come to Fuertes on Friday night to learn more about
many aspects of the early universe, and a little bit about my research over the last summer
at the UCLA Physics/Astronomy REU. </p>

<p class="title"> Facts and Myths of the LHC, and the consequences for Astronomy </p>
<p class="presenter"> Stephen Demjanenko </p>
<p class="abstract">The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been greatly publicized in recent
news, and as such, many myths and unwarranted fears have cropped up. The
idea, for example, that the LHC could create black holes and be the cause
of Earth's Doomsday have been spread around by the press.  However, this
is not the case; the LHC is safe.  Moreover, the scientific community has
great anticipation for this machine to advance the boundaries of particle
physics. Come to Fuertes on Friday to learn about the real science behind
the LHC, and why, among other things, it will not create a black hole to
devour the Earth! </p>

<p class="title"> Astronomical Tests of General Relativy </p>
<p class="presenter"> Hong Yu Xiao </p>
<p class="abstract">Since the late 1600s, Newton has reigned supreme in the universe with
his universal law of gravitation that binds planets, stars and galaxies together. More than
two centuries later, Einstein puts forward his theory of general relativity to explain
gravity in a wholly new way. Who is right in this battle of titans? </p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 14</p>
<p class="title"> The Many Moons of Jupiter </p>
<p class="presenter"> Richard Gustavson </p>
<p class="abstract">Come explore the many moons of Jupiter, with 62 (and counting!) moons to
choose from.  The three main groups of moons, the Amalthea Group, the Galilean Moons, and the
irregular satellites, each have unique characteristics, with each individual moon a world of
its own.  Learn how the moons were formed, their interactions with Jupiter and each other,
and whether we might one day find life in their midst.</p>
