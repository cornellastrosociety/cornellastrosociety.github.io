<p>Many Cornell alumni have fond memories of their first encounter with
the mysteries of the night sky at Fuertes Observatory, located on a
grassy knoll overlooking the north shore of Beebe Lake. Although the
present building has stood on this site since 1917, many people are
surprised to learn that it is in fact the fourth or fifth astronomical
observatory on the Cornell campus. The first, albeit rather primitive,
<a href="gs.html">wooden observatory building</a> was built between 1876 and 1882 and was
located on the Arts Quad where now stands the north end of Goldwin
Smith Hall. The main impetus for its construction came from
Prof. Estevan Antonio Fuertes, the Dean and first professor of Civil
Engineering at Cornell and a devotee of practical, laboratory-based
learning. Throughout the Fall term, engineering seniors used the
observatory's telescopes to measure stars for calculations of time and
position. Their summer was spent in field work, surveying the Finger
Lakes.</p>

<p>Born in Puerto Rico, educated in fine arts in Barcelona and in
engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY, where he
graduated in 1857, <a href="estevan.html">Prof. Fuertes</a> was a successful civil engineer who
had worked on public infrastructure in Puerto Rico, on the Croton
aqueduct for New York City, and on early Panama canal surveys for the
US Government. He was lured to Cornell in 1873 by Andrew Dickson
White's vision of a new university where practical training would
coexist with traditional academic learning. Fuertes schooled many
generations of civil engineers in the art of astronomical
observations, necessary to establish accurate geographical surveys as
well as time-keeping in the days before GPS satellites and radio time
signals. He was a much-loved figure at Cornell, nicknamed "The Mogue"
because of his supposed resemblance to the Mogul emperor of India
whose likeness appeared on cigarette packs of the day. His house stood
on the site of the present Statler Hotel, and he organized musical
recitals at nearby Sage College in the evenings.  Cornell's famed
Ornithological Laboratory is named for his son, Louis Agassiz Fuertes,
a Cornell graduate of 1897. Estevan retired due to ill-health in 1902
after 29 years of teaching and died early the following year.</p>

<p>Demolished in 1892 to make way for the Dairy Building, the first of
Cornell's Agriculture College buildings, the original observatory was
rebuilt by 1896 on or near what is now the site of Day Hall (1), but
apparently it remained a rather ramshackle wooden structure which was
deemed a "standing reproach to the campus". Around 1902, trustee
General Alfred C. Barnes offered to provide a more suitable building
to house the observatory and its geodetic equipment.  Contemporary
postcards show a <a href="barton.html">handsome brick building</a>, 80 feet by 20 feet and
topped with three domes, which was completed in September 1903 (2). It
was situated across East Avenue, on an eminence to the south of the
old Veterinary College, on what is now the site of Barton Hall. The
Observatory boasted a 5-inch equatorial telescope, two transit
telescopes for timing and stellar position measurements, as well as
more specialized surveying instruments, an astronomical clock and a
spacious "computing room".  Unfortunately, this fine facility was
demolished in 1914 or 1915 to make way for the huge new drill hall.</p>

<hr />

<p>Soon afterwards, however, plans were laid for a new Fuertes
Observatory, to be located on the Hasbrouck poultry farm to the north
of Beebe Lake.  Construction was undertaken by the Cornell
Superintendant of Buildings and Grounds in April 1916, following a
design by Prof. of Architecture, L. P. Burnham and under the
supervision of the Department of Civil Engineering. Of concrete block
and stucco construction, 87 by 18 feet with a 24-foot diameter steel
dome, the building was completed in the Fall of 1917 at a total cost
of $20,000. Support for a future 12-inch telescope was provided by a
set of four 30-foot-long steel I-beams built into the structure,
rather than the conventional masonry pier.  Initially the old 5-inch
equatorial telescope was installed in the dome, but in 1919
Prof. Irving P. Church, head of the Civil Engineering department and
another afficionado of practical astronomy, procured two 12-inch glass
blanks declared surplus by the Yerkes Observatory in Chicago.  The
two-element lens was ground and polished by the well-known firm of
Brashear & Co and delivered to Cornell in 1920.</p>

<p>Under Prof. Church's continued urging and leadership, money to
construct a suitable telescope mounting was raised from among the
engineering alumni and in January 1922 a contract was given to the
Warner and Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio, who had built both the
Lick 36-inch and Yerkes 40-inch refractors. The present
12-inch telescope with its German equatorial mount was installed in
October 1922 and officially dedicated on June 15, 1923 as the "Irving
Porter Church Memorial Telescope."  A graduate of Cornell's early
civil engineering program in 1873, Professor Church had retired in
1916 after 40 years of service to the University.  Author of a
widely-used textbook on "The Mechanics of Engineering", he was also
considered a co-founder, along with Estevan Fuertes, of the
present-day concept of technical education. He died in 1931. In 1964
the Irving Porter Church professorship in engineering was endowed in
his honor, and &mdash; fittingly &mdash; the present occupant of this chair is
our own Prof. of Astronomy Joseph A. Burns.</p>

<p>On its ground floor, the new observatory housed a transit room with
four concrete piers, a classroom, a computing room, an office and
secure storage rooms, as well as display cases for astronomical
photographs and lantern slides, while in the basement there was a
temperature-controlled room with double-glass windows for the
astronomical clock, constant-temperature rooms for geodetic lab work,
a photographic darkroom and a room for the "comparator", previously
housed in Lincoln Hall. In addition to the 12-inch telescope, it was
equipped with three transit telescopes, a zenith instrument and an
altazimuth, as well as assorted sextants, surveyor's transits,
collimators and meteorological recording equipment. In later years, a
mirror-grinding shop was installed in the basement. Much of the old
optical equipment remains in storage at the observatory, although the
best pieces have been refurbished and are on display in Snee Hall.</p>

<hr />

<p>Introductory laboratory classes in astronomy continue to be taught at
Fuertes, which has remained largely unchanged for over 80 years.  In
the 1960s, responsibility for the Observatory was transferred to the
new Center for Radio and Space Research (CRSR). In the 1980s the
original leaky roof with its clamshell doors above the "transit room"
in the eastern wing of the building was replaced by a conventional
fixed roof. At some earlier date the original coal-fired furnace,
reputedly tended by a live-in student, was replaced by a gas heater.</p>

<p>However, the campus itself has grown immensely over this period, and
what must once have been a remote site with dark skies is now hemmed
in by the residential and dining facilities of North Campus, while the
southern sky is regularly spoilt by the lights of Schoellkopf stadium.
As a result, it is now difficult to see the Milky Way from the rooftop
deck at Fuertes, or even most of the fainter naked-eye stars. Only the
moon, planets and the brightest stars remain readily visible to the
unaided eye.</p>

<p>In the future, the Astronomy Department would like to construct a new
facility for upper-level observing labs at a dark site, perhaps on Mt
Pleasant adjacent to our existing Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory, or
perhaps in the Cornell Plantations as part of a proposed Gateway
Center off NYS Route 366.  But its convenience for undergraduates,
appeal to alumni and long history all argue for maintaining Fuertes as
a functioning observatory well into the forseeable future.</p>

<p>The authors would like to acknowledge their debt to previous research
on the history of Fuertes by Brian McLeod, Jeff Regester and Eric
Weisstein, all past-presidents of the Cornell Astronomical Society.
For at least 40 years, and perhaps much longer, the CAS has
operated Friday Night open houses at the Observatory, inspiring
generations of eager star-gazers of all ages.</p>

<li>Hewitt (1905), on p. 342, reports the site of the second
observatory to have been that now occupied by Stimson Hall, built in
1903 to house the Ithaca division of the Cornell Medical School, but
this appears to be contradicted by contemporary campus maps reproduced
by Parsons (1968) on p. 203, which place it further south. It is even
possible that there were two observatories during this period.</li>

plan of future development on the Cornell Campus, by 1914 it was known
officially as the "Fuertes Astronomical Observatory and Geodetic
Laboratory".  </li>
