<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2005</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required.</p>

<p class="title">The Huygens Mission to Titan</p>
<p class="presenter">Richard "Doc" Kinne</p>
<p class="abstract">On January 14th, just a fortnight ago, humanity claimed yet 
another new world as Huygens landed on Saturn's moon, Titan. From this frigid and 
distant satellite, Earth's robotic emissary radioed its findings back home.<br /><br />
What did Huygens see as it descended through Titan's orange hued atmosphere? What 
did Huygens hear as it wafted through the cold methane clouds? What did Huygens 
feel as it landed on this entirely new and alien world?</p>

<p class="date">February 11</p>
<p class="title">Light Pollution</p>
<p class="presenter">Debbie Audus</p>
<p class="abstract">What exactly is light pollution? How does artificial 
lighting pollute the earth? How does it affect us? How can we still have the 
lighting that we need?  And what can we do about it?</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">March 11</p>
<p class="title">Galaxies</p>
<p class="presenter">David Eisler</p>
<p class="abstract">From our own Milky Way to distant systems, the talk will present 
an overview on galaxies, their evolution, and topics of current research.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">April 8</p>
<p class="title">The Expanding Universe</p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">How does the universe "work"? What is the true nature and 
mechanism behind everything? While no one can really know for certain, modern 
cosmology proposes some interesting answers to such fundamental questions. This 
lecture will present a brief introduction to some cosmological theories that might 
explain the expansive nature of the universe.<br /><br />
So how do we know that the universe is expanding? What is meant by "expanding 
universe"? And simply, How does that work? Come to the Fuertes Observatory this 
Friday evening to find out.</p>
