<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2006</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required.</p>

<p class="title">The Pluto Pink-Slip Controversy</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">The recent demotion of Pluto to "dwarf planet" upset many people
  (and not just Disney fans). However, such downsizing has happened
  in the past, to the asteroids. In fact, the whole process is a
  good example of science in action, where old theories need to be
  altered (sometimes with controversy) as new empirical data come in.
  In order to understand the background of the International Astronomical
  Union's decision process for Pluto, we will look at the history of
  planetary discovery from William Herschel's 1781 finding of Uranus
  onwards. (And if we somehow have clear skies, after the talk we'll
  try to observe some of the suspects involved: Uranus, Neptune,
  and Ceres.)</p>

<p class="title">Telescopes Throughout the Ages (with a focus on the James Webb Space Telescope)</p>
<p class="presenter">Kim-Yen Nguyen</p>
<p class="abstract">The Hubble Space Telescope is quite possibly the most 
famous astronomical instrument that has been in operation within the past 
fifty years. It has sent home innumerable breathtaking and highly informative 
images of what has not heretofore been possible to see from the ground. 
However, having been launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope is beginning 
to get a bit old. The field of astronomy needs a new toy. Enter the James 
Webb Space Telescope (JWST), previously known as the New Generation Space Telescope.  
What can JWST do? How does it compare with Hubble? Spitzer? Other telescopes on 
the ground? What will we find in the Great Beyond with this newfangled toy?</p>

<p class="title">Ancient Astronomy</p>
<p class="presenter">Christie Gibson and Ishan Sharma</p>
<p class="abstract">We may sometimes like to think that today we've made great 
leaps in the field of astronomy only in the last few hundred years, but our 
ancestors weren't clueless. From the megalithic stones at Stonehenge to Mayan 
observatories, ancient ruins can help us discover how our ancestors appreciated 
the heavens. We'll explore some of these ancient ruins (through photography, 
of course!) and see how these ruins give us an insight into astronomy in 
the past.</p>

<p class="title">Shedding Light on Black Holes</p>
<p class="presenter">Adam Kolozetti</p>
<p class="abstract">Interested in our galaxy and beyond? Ever wonder about
just what extraordinary mysteries the universe holds in
store for us? Come find out about one such mystery, the
infamous Black Hole. Do black holes exist? If yes, where
do they come from? What happens if you fall in one? What
would that look like? Included, a discussion of wormholes,
and a closer look at exactly what is gravity and its
relationship to black holes. If you feel that Star Trek
is not giving you satisfactory answers on these topics,
come find out the real details about one of the most
fascinating wonders of science.</p>

<p class="title">Stories of the Stars: Mythology and the Night Sky</p>
<p class="presenter">Brian Crandall</p>
<p class="abstract">The night sky has mystified and inspired 
us since the dawn of civilization. As man has gazed into the 
vast unknown, creative minds have conjured stories of fantastic 
creatures, amazing figures and prodigious events to try and 
explain the stars, the planets and the glorious reaches of 
space. Come join us for a recollection of these colorful and 
entrancing tales, and discover how our celestial sphere is 
as much a storybook as it is an awesome view.</p>

<p class="date">December 1</p>
<p class="title">Mythology of Southern Constellations</p>
<p class="presenter">Lisa Bacis and Elise Christensen</p>
<p class="abstract">The Southern hemisphere... What is out there? As Northern hemisphere
   natives, we have an absent-minded disregard for the skies in the Land
   Down Under. In our narcissistic and egocentric tendencies, we have no
   idea what constellations grace the southern skies. What fantastic stories
   limn their forgotten and forlorn skies? We hope to uncover some of the
   many foggy mysteries of this foreign place.</p>
