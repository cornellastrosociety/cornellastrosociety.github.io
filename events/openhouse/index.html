                    The Fuertes Observatory will be open to the public from 10 PM on Thursday night, March 13th, until 6 AM on Friday morning, March 14th, for the observing of the upcoming total eclipse of the Moon. <b>The eclipse does not start until midnight</b>, but the building will be open for two hours prior. The eclipse occurs in several phases:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">11:57:28 PM: Start of penumbral eclipse.</span> The Moon becomes very slightly dimmer, as it is shadowed by Earth's penumbra.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">1:09 AM: Start of partial eclipse.</span> Earth's umbral shadow begins to be cast upon the Moon, significantly dimming a growing portion of the Moon.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">2:26 AM: Start of total eclipse.</span> The Moon is completely within Earth's umbral shadow, and begins to turn reddish.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">2:58:43 AM: Maximum eclipse.</span> The Moon is as centered as it will be within Earth's shadow.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">3:31 AM: End of total eclipse.</span> The Moon loses its red color and is again only partially eclipsed.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">4:47 AM: End of partial eclipse.</span> The Moon no longer has an umbral shadow cast upon it, but is still shadowed by Earth's penumbra.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">6:00:09 AM: End of penumbral eclipse.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>Unlike a solar eclipse, there is no danger to observing the moon during an eclipse without specialized equipment or filters, so one does not need any sort of eclipse glasses to view this event. Observation of the eclipse is dependent on the weather; if the skies are overcast and the moon cannot be seen, then the eclipse will not be visible either. Comprehensive plots regarding the weather at Fuertes and the surrounding area, including cloud cover, can be found on our <a href="/visit/weather">Weather page</a>.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>The eclipse can be observed from anywhere in North or South America – not just from the observatory. Visitors to Fuertes between midnight and 6 AM will be able to observe the eclipse from our observation deck, or through our telescopes, including the historic 12-inch Irving Porter Church refractor. Volunteers from the Cornell Astronomical Society will guide visitors through viewing and provide information about the event.</div>

                <p>Fuertes Observatory is open every Friday night during the Cornell academic year from 8 PM until midnight (regardless of weather) and occasionally at other times, as announced in the status bar above, on our <a href="/#email">mailing list</a>, and on our <a href="/">home page</a>. <a href="/events/lectures">Lectures</a> are given on select Friday nights in an external building on North Campus. Open house nights begin after each lecture.</p>
                <p>When clear, public viewing takes place through the observatory's telescopes. Tours of the historic building, the <a href="/about/telescope">Irving Porter Church Refractor</a>, and our museum will be given throughout the night, regardless of the weather.</p>
                <p>You can also visit our <a href="/visit/hours">Hours & Directions</a> page for hours, directions, parking information.</p>
                <p>For accessibility information, see our <a href="/visit/accessibility">Accessibility</a> page.</p>

                <span style="color: rgb(140, 191, 233); font-size: 24px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Fuertes Observatory Guidelines</span>
                <p>When you attend an open house night at the Fuertes Observatory, please be respectful of the volunteers and other observers. Please <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(220, 178, 60);">do not use flash photography, cell phones,</span> and other sources of white light while observing is taking place. In order to see faint detail in galaxies and nebulae, the eyes must be fully dark adapted, which takes several minutes. Any source of white light will interfere with this adjustment and will disturb other observers.</p>
                <p>Dress appropriately for the season! The dome room and deck of the observatory are both unheated, and the temperature often falls rapidly after sunset.</p>
                <p>Children are welcome, but must be accompanied by an adult at all times.</p>
                <p>Smoking of any kind (including e-cigarettes) is strictly prohibited in or around the observatory and on the observing deck. Pets are not allowed in the building.</p>
