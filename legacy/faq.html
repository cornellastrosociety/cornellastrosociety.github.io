<a name="north" id="north"></a>
<h3>1) Where are the North Star and Big Dipper?</h3>

<p>Ok, first you have to figure out where north is and face that way.
 (Hint: Fuertes is on the eastern edge of NORTH Campus. In which direction
 is the Arts Quad? Further hint, if it's early in the evening: where did
 the Sun set, and what's the relationship between that direction and north?)
 Once you're facing north, look up not quite halfway between the horizon
 and directly overhead. There will be a medium-bright star situated in a
 somewhat empty area of the sky. That's Polaris, the North Star. The Big
 Dipper, which is only part of the constellation Ursa Major (the Big Bear),
 will be somewhere nearby&mdash;where, exactly, will depend upon the time of year
 and time of night, but it is always above the horizon (it is "circumpolar")
 as seen from Ithaca. The two stars that form the edge of the bowl of
 the Big Dipper farthest from the handle point almost but not exactly at Polaris.
</p>

<p>By the way, Polaris is not always the North Star. In fact, at times there
 is <span class="superem">no</span> "North Star". The Earth spins like a top, of course,
 but a wobbling top. Over a cycle of 26,000 years, the North and South Poles
 point towards different directions in the sky; this is called 
 <span class="defn">precession</span>. About 4000 years ago, a star in the 
 constellation Draco (the Dragon) was the North Star; in some 13,000 years, the very 
 bright star Vega in the constellation Lyra (the Lyre) will be it.

<a name="whereis" id="whereis"></a>
<h3>2) Where is / Can we look at [insert your favorite object here]?</h3>

<p>It depends upon several things: 1) what time of the year is it? 2) what
 time of the night is it? and for planets and the Moon, 3) where are they
 in their orbits about the Sun? (Orbit around the Earth, in the case of
 the Moon...) Some constellations, like Orion and Gemini, are winter
 constellations&mdash;by mid-to-late spring they're setting nearly at
 sunset, and in the summer the Sun is in the same section of the sky so
 they can't be seen at all from the Earth's surface. Conversely, Scorpius
 and Sagittarius are summer constellations, and not visible in the winter.
 For faint objects (i.e., almost all star clusters and galaxies), the
 glare of the moon can wash them out. Thus, at nearly full moon it may be
 too bright, even out in the country-side, to see something that's up in
 the sky.
</p>
 
<p>The planets of course move around the Sun over the course of months
 or years; they therefore change their position in the sky each night.
 (This is, in fact where the name derives from: the Classical Greek
 word <span class="defn">planetes</span> means "wanderers.") You thus
 have to determine
 where a planet is in the sky for a given night, and then determine
 whether that section of sky is visible on said night.
</p>

<p>(There are of course more mundane considerations, such as if the
 object is behind a tree, a building, or&mdash;especially in
 Ithaca&mdash;clouds. And on public observing nights, sometimes it
 just gets too busy at Fuertes to take special requests.)

<h3>3A) Why are there two times on the observatory clock, and why is one wrong?</h3>
<h3>3B) How do you keep the telescope pointed?</h3>
<h3>3C) What's the spinning thing inside the telescope mount?</h3>

<p>The "wrong" time on the clock shows the <span class="defn">sidereal
 time</span>, which is
 which "line of celestial longitude" (the technical term is "meridian
 of right ascension") is passing overhead. We define a "day" to be the
 time it takes the Sun to complete one circuit around the sky. Since
 the Earth is constantly moving in its orbit around the Sun, this
 period is longer than the time taken for Earth to spin once around
 its axis by around 4 minutes. As a result, a particular meridian of
 right ascension is overhead 4 minutes earlier each successive day,
 so sidereal time gains 4 minutes a day relative to clock time. (This
 is why the constellations change with the seasons: over time we're
 looking out at different sections of the sky.) At the start of an
 evening's observing we use the sidereal time to calibrate where the
 telescope is pointing. There is a "right ascension calibration wheel"
 on the telescope column, consisting of two disks with graded tick
 marks&mdash;vaguely reminiscent of a sundial, except it's flat and
 vertical. We set this based on the current sidereal time. When we've
 been moving the telescope around for a while and we want to double-check
 where we think we're pointing (e.g., if we think we're at a target
 based on what we see in the eyepiece, but the target isn't there...),
 we consult that wheel.
</p>

<p>Now, if we were just to point the telescope at something and did
 nothing further, the object would move out of the field of view
 within a minute because of the Earth's rotation. There is a clock 
 drive mechanism inside the central column of the telescope that keeps
 the telescope tracking along with the apparent motion of the heavens.
 It is entirely mechanical, and is in effect a big grandfather clock:
 there is a weight inside the column, and we have to crank it up about
 once an hour. The spinning thing is simply a pair of weights that is
 part of the clock drive; if we see that they are no longer spinning
 (and haven't been looking in the telescope for the last few minutes),
 we know we have to wind up the clock drive! (At that point we also
 have to reset the right ascension calibration wheel.)

<h3>4) How many galaxies are there?</h3>

<p>Waaaay more than anyone had the remotest idea about as of 1990.</p>

<p>Based on then-existing sky surveys, the answer around 1990 would've
 been something like, "There could be several hundred million galaxies."
 Then came the
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1996/01/">
	Hubble Deep Field</a>,
 one of the most important images to
 come from the Hubble Space Telescope. In December, 1995, the telescope
 was pointed at an "empty" patch of sky (i.e., no visible galaxies and
 only a couple of dim stars) and over ten days took 342 images at various
 wavelengths. The resulting composite image showed over <em>two thousand</em>
 galaxies, a result that completely stunned everyone. It was followed by the
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/07/">
	Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF)</a>,
 released in 2004. There, in a field of view only 1/10 the area of the
 full moon, were some 10,000 galaxies. Furthermore, they were all
 extreeeemely distant galaxies. One of the nearest galaxies in the
 image is about one billion light-years away (i.e., the light from it,
 moving at 186,000 miles each second, has taken one billion years to
 reach us); some of the furthest galaxies in the image could be well
 over 10 billion light-years away, and so some of the earliest galaxies
 to form. Extrapolating from the HUDF, the lower bound on the number of
 galaxies is now on the order of 120 billion. It's safe to say that that
 number can be raised with improved observational instruments.
</p>

<p>In August 2009, after the final repair mission, Hubble
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/cosmology/2010/02/">
 reimaged part of the
 Ultra Deep Field in infrared light</a>, seeing galaxies even further away: it
 is estimated that those galaxies show how conditions were in the universe only
 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang, the beginning of the
 universe. The successor to Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope, which is
 scheduled to be launched in 2014, will take even more sensitive pictures in
 the infrared and thus be able to study such early galaxies in more detail.
</p>

<p>A good recent book on the HUDF and its implications for cosmology,
 written for general audiences, is Jeff Kanipe's <span class="title">Chasing Hubble's
 Shadow: The Search for Galaxies at the Edge of Time</span> (New York:
 Hill and Wang, 2006).
</p>

<p>
(By the way, until the 1920s it was not even known whether there was only ONE galaxy: our
Milky Way. Objects like the Andromeda Galaxy were known as "spiral nebulae," i.e., things
within our galaxy that had spiral structures instead of looking like glowing gas clouds. The
nature of such objects was a matter of deep controversy, and there was a famous "Great
Debate" in 1920 about them. The excellent myth-debunking

 website has

	more information and pointers to details</a>
about this controversy.)

<h3>5) How do you find stuff in the telescope?</h3>

<p>The field of view in the main telescope is too narrow to use for
 finding anything. We have to zero in on an object over a multi-step
 process called "star-hopping."
</p>

<p>We begin by consulting the books of detailed star charts to find a
 chart that has both the object we're going to look for and a starting
 object&mdash;some fairly bright star&mdash;on the same page. Next, we
 get the starting object centered in the small "finder" telescope that's
 attached to the main scope. We then alternate moving slowly along the
 north-south and east-west axes, going from star to star as depicted on
 the chart (and consulting the chart repeatedly!), until we get to the
 object we're looking for, or close enough that we can pan along in the
 main telescope if the object is too faint to be seen reliably in the
 finder. We only move along one axis at a time because we would get
 immediately lost (unless we were very experienced and the next target
 were very close by!) if we tried to go diagonally.
</p>

<p>(This leaves out a couple of details of the process, such as moving
 the dome so that the object in question is visible through the slit!)

<h3>6) What do things like "M42" and "NGC 205" mean?</h3>

<p>These are catalog numbers referring to various objects (luminous gas
 clouds, star clusters, galaxies) in the sky. "M-objects" are on a list
 drawn up by Charles Messier, an 18th century French astronomer. He was
 trying to find comets, but he and his assistant Pierre M&eacute;chain kept
 finding various faint fuzzy things. At first annoyed by these repeated false
 alarms, he eventually realized that these were apparently different types
 of "deep-sky objects" and published a list giving the locations in the sky
 of said fuzzy things as a service to other astronomers. Messier published
 a couple of revisions over his lifetime; a few posthumous entries were
 added, bringing the total to 110. Messier of course did not know the actual
 natures of most of the objects he saw, and neither did any other
 astronomer of his day. 
</p>

<p>NGC stands for "New General Catalog." It is a much larger catalog of
 objects, first published under the editorship of John L. E. Dreyer in
 1888, that covers both
 the Northern and Southern hemispheres&mdash;Messier could only list
 objects visible from France, and his telescope was less powerful.
 The NGC has been revised, and several supplements have been added
 over the decades. In addition, a few other catalogs of various types
 of astronomical objects have been published; these go beyond visible-light
 objects (e.g., the 3rd Cambridge Catalog of radio sources).
</p>

<p>In the late 1970's, someone noticed that there is a window of about
 10 days in late March when it is theoretically possible to see all or
 nearly all the objects in the Messier catalog in a single dusk-to-dawn
 viewing session. This is called a "Messier Marathon," and it has become
 a very popular activity for amateur astronomy clubs. For more
 information on Messier marathons, click
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/marathon/marathon.html">
    here</a>.
 We have attempted a couple of marathons in recent years; you can
 read about the relative success of those efforts

<h3>7) What do these names like "Delta Orionis" mean? Why is it "Orionis"
 and not "Orion?"</h3>

<p>Some stars have their own proper names, like Rigel (in Orion), Vega
 (in Lyra), or Polaris (in Ursa Minor). These are either prominent,
 bright stars, or they occupy particular places in the constellations.
 (For example, two fun star names are Zubenelgenubi and Zubeneschamali,
 Arabic names meaning "The Southern Claw" and "The Northern Claw,"
 respectively; the stars are in Libra, the Balance. Libra used to be
 part of Scorpius, the Scorpion; these stars were its two claws.)
</p>

<p>Most stars, however, don't have special names. For those such stars
 visible to the eye, we use a system developed by Johann Bayer in the
 17th century. He ranked stars in constellations in order from brightest
 to dimmest, using letters of the Greek alphabet: Alpha is the brightest
 star of a constellation, Beta the second brightest, etc. When the Greek
 alphabet has been exhausted, numbers are used. This latter system was
 devised by the 17th century British astronomer John Flamsteed, who
 assigned numbers even to stars that Bayer had given letter designations;
 most people only use the Flamsteed numbers for stars that do not have
 proper names or Greek letters.
</p>

<p>As to why it's Orionis rather than Orion, etc.&mdash;these are just
 the genitive (possessive) cases of the Latin names/words for the 
 constellations. Thus, "Delta Orionis" is "4th brightest star of the
 constellation Orion." While you need to learn Latin for the details
 (and it's very useful to know Latin, so you should consider it!),
 for nearly all the constellations the rules are: 1) if the name ends
 in "a" (Lyra, Andromeda,...), the genitive will end in "ae" (Lyrae,
 Andromedae,...); 2) if the name ends in "us" or "um" (Cygnus, Cepheus,
 Scutum,...), the genitive will end in "i" (Cygni, Cephei, Scuti,...);
 3) anything else (Orion, Virgo,...) is likely a "3rd declension noun,"
 which indicates a sort of kitchen-sink situation re whether/how the
 base portion of the noun changes&mdash;simple answer is, memorize the
 genitive versions.
</p>

<p>By the way, there's a very simple reason why very few stars have
 proper names&mdash;there are waaaay too many! Under ideal (pre-Industrial
 Revolution) conditions, about 6000 stars are visible to the unaided eye.
 In even a modest telescope, there are tens of thousands visible, and
 millions visible in the largest research scopes.

<h3>8) Have you ever seen a UFO?</h3>

<p>If you mean, "Have you ever seen an alien spaceship?", there are no such
 things as UFOs. If you feel that that needs a more detailed reply, click
<a href="#ufo2">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Now if, instead, you were really asking, "Have you ever seen moving
 lights in the night sky?" then, sure, tons of times. In most such cases,
 these were planes or helicopters&mdash;the blinking, differently-colored
 navigation lights and especially the jet/helicopter sounds are good
 giveaways! In all the other cases (i.e., steady silent light moving
 fairly quickly, usually in a more or less easterly direction), they
 were some sort of human-launched satellite&mdash;there are now a
 large number of satellites orbiting the earth, and it's a lot more
 common nowadays to see them going by than it was in the 1960s.
</p>

<p>Occasionally, one can see a very bright light in the sky that fades
 in out of nowhere, moves a bit, and fades out again over the course
 of a few seconds. While these can seem mysterious the first time one
 sees them, they are just reflections off satellites. Such occurrences
 are called <span class="defn">Iridium Flares</span>. Iridiums are a
 set of several dozen
 satellites in low-earth orbit, launched and maintained by the Iridium
 LLC Consortium, to support mobile communications. They each have three
 large antennae, which are always pointed at certain angles relative to
 their direction of travel. These antennae are, in effect, big mirrors in
 orbit. Once you know the satellite's orbit and the angle of the Sun,
 it's straightforward (if somewhat involved) trigonometry to determine
 when someone at a given ground position can see the Sun's light
 momentarily reflecting off these antennae as the satellite goes by, and
 how bright the reflection will be.
 You can click
<a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/main.asp?Loc=Ithaca&amp;Lat=42.441&amp;Lng=-76.497&amp;Alt=137&amp;TZ=EST">
     here</a>
 to find when Iridium Flares or passes of the International Space Station
 and the Hubble Space Telescope might be visible from Ithaca over the
 next ten days.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, people have mistaken planets for UFOs. Venus and
 Jupiter, and even one or two stars, are bright enough to be
 visible in the daytime if you know exactly where to look, especially
 with binoculars, and though they are stationary points of light they will 
 sometimes appear to be slowly moving (an optical illusion psychologists 
 call the <span class="defn">autokinetic effect</span>). Also, if the
 geometry is just right, some Iridium Flares are visible during the
 daytime&mdash;and those <i><b>do</b></i> move!

<h3>9) Have you ever met Steve Squyres? Can you get his autograph? How about Jim Bell?</h3>

<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, this question would've been about Carl
 Sagan. Yes, some of us have met Profs. Squyres and Bell; a couple
 of us have even worked for them. They are both very nice
 gentlemen, and really good teachers and public speakers. They are
 also incredibly busy and are going to be so for many years to come,
 given how long the two Mars rovers have lasted and the amount of
 data that the rovers have returned. We don't ask for their autographs. We
 request that you don't, either, unless you and they are both at a
 public book-signing.

<a name="superscope" id="superscope"></a>
<h3>10) How powerful is this telescope?</h3>

<p>There's no single quantity as the "power" of a telescope. You can, 
 however, ask about its magnification, or its ability to gather light, 
 or other specific capabilities.</p>

<p>Magnification depends on which eyepiece we have in. A telescope's magnification
 is determined by dividing its length by the focal length of the eyepiece
 being used. The Fuertes scope is 15 ft. long, which is 4572mm. We normally
 use a 32mm or 26mm eyepiece for observing; these give magnifications
 of just under 143 and 180 times the apparent size in the sky, respectively.
 We have several other eyepieces all the way down to a 9mm, for a
 magnification of 508; the smallest eyepiece we tend to use is a
 12mm, which gives a magnification of 381.
</p>

<p>The tradeoffs of higher magnification are: 1) a narrower field
 of view; and 2) less light coming into the eyepiece, so it's
 harder to see details. The contrast when using the 12mm eyepiece
 is a lot less than when using a 26mm or 32mm eyepiece. Thus, for the
 types of viewing we can do with this telescope (especially given
 the light pollution around Fuertes), the lower magnifications are
 actually better most of the time. In Fall 2005 we acquired a
 wide-angle 40mm eyepiece, which lets in a lot more light, and in
 which the full moon will just barely fit.
</p>

<p>Some people ask, "How far can the telescope see?" Stated that way,
 the question is pretty meaningless&mdash;we're really just looking towards
 infinity and sometimes there are things in the way.:) Stated
 instead as "What's the farthest object you can see with the
 telescope?", then the issue is, how bright is an object
 vis-&agrave;-vis its distance&mdash;we can't see the (former)
 planet Pluto, within our own solar system, much less tiny asteroids
 that come within a few million miles of the Earth, but we can see
 quite a few galaxies trillions of times further away because they
 shine with the light of hundreds of billions of stars. We have regularly
 seen galaxies in a group called the Virgo Cluster, estimated to be spread
 between 40 to 60 million light-years away; for some of its galaxies, dinosaurs
 were still around when the light began coming here.
</p>

<p>The most commonly cited "farthest object" visible with a telescope in our size
 bracket is the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasar</a>
 3C&nbsp;273, also in the constellation Virgo. It is something
 like 2.5 billion light years away; when that light began
 coming here, the only lifeforms on Earth were bacteria that did not
 even have cell nuclei. In May 2009 we confirmed
 that it <i>is</i> visible from Fuertes (at least, if the North Campus lights are
 off!). We haven't tried looking for any other quasars; they are likely all
 too faint for this telescope, even if every light in Tompkins County were
 turned off.

<h3>11A) Why are the dome lights red?</h3>
<h3>11B) Can we take pictures?</h3>
<h3>11C) Why do you get upset when we use our cell phones?</h3>

<p>Human eyes are least sensitive to red light. By using red lights,
 we can have enough illumination to do things like read the star
 charts or not trip over the ladder supports while still retaining
 some dark adaptation so we can see things in the telescope. Full
 dark adaptation takes over 40 minutes; any sort of bright or
 flashing lights will knock out the dark adaptation. (If we have
 to go downstairs, you may notice that we sometimes keep a hand
 over one eye, to conserve some of the dark adaptation we've built
 up.) Hence, we take an <i>extreeeeemely</i> "dim" view of visitors
 who do any sort of flash photography, whip open their brightly-lit
 cellphones, etc.
</p>

<p>If you would like to take pictures, there are several options. First,
 if your camera or whatever can do long exposures, consider doing an
 existing-light picture using only the red lights. This will be a much
 more dramatic and interesting picture than something done with flash!
 Second, if you can hang out until closing or can come back another
 night as we're starting, you can take pictures while we have the white
 light on. Finally, if your parents or out-of-town friends are here for
 their one and only visit ever to Fuertes, you're all about to leave,
 and you reaaaally need to take a picture right <i>now</i>,
 <u><i><b>please</b></i></u> ask us first, so we can warn others and
 turn away/cover our eyes before you use any flash!

<a name="eyepiece" id="eyepiece"></a>
<h3>12) Which eyepiece do I look through?</h3>

<p>You want to look through the one in the center of the main barrel
 of the telescope. The smaller telescope mounted on the side of the
 main one is a finder scope&mdash;we use it to
<a href="#finding">
    home in on what we're aiming at</a>.
 (You can, of course, peek through the finder scope as well, if you
 want to see the difference; the view will be substantially different.)
 You may find it difficult to look through only one eye. Some
 observers prefer to leave <em>both</em> eyes open (instead of squinting
 the other shut), and covering the non-observing eye with their hand.
 Also, some people who wear glasses find it better to take them off
 before looking in the scope; others prefer to keep their glasses on.

<a name="pictures" id="pictures"></a>
<h3>13) Were the pictures across from the sign-up table taken through
 the telescope?</h3>

<p>A few were; not many. Some are clearly labeled as predating
 Fuertes Observatory (e.g., the sketches of Mars from 1909; the
 observatory wasn't built until 1917 or 1919&mdash;the sources
 contradict each other&mdash;and the telescope wasn't
 installed until 1923). Many require better resolution
 than is obtainable in our telescope, or equipment that we don't
 have (e.g., the pictures of the Sun with the Sun's disk blocked out).
</p>

<p>A couple of pictures, such as the one of Halley's Comet during its
 1986 pass, were taken here. We once had darkroom facilities, although
 the equipment therein was really obsolete by today's standards; due
 to environmental concerns (chemical runoff would go straight into
 Beebe Lake), those facilities have been shut down. In the past few
 years we began
<a href="ccd.html">
      building a CCD camera</a>
 "by kit" so as to be able
 to do digital photography. That project was never finished before
 the technology we were then using became itself obsolete,
 although we did get as far as taking
<a href="asphotos/firstlight.html">
      an image of Mars</a>
 as a first test. The real problem with photography from Fuertes
 is, of course, the amount of light pollution around Ithaca and
 North Campus in particular.

<h3>14) What discoveries were made here?</h3>

<p>None, unfortunately. Even when it was built, the Fuertes
 Observatory was not state of the art. Its primary purpose was
 for teaching skills necessary for naval navigation and civil
 engineering surveying. See the
<a href="fuertes.html">

 expert on the history of Cornell observatories, if she's

<h3>15) I heard there's another observatory on campus. Is it better/worse?</h3>

<p>The Astronomy Department maintains a small observatory, named the 
<a href="http://coursewiki.astro.cornell.edu/Astro4410/HartungBoothroydObservatory">
      Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory</a>, 
 a few miles outside of town. It is not open to the public; it is
 used primarily for the training of astronomy majors, to
 give them some experience in "driving a 'real' telescope."
 Like all research telescopes, it is primarily computer-driven:
 to aim it, one sits in a control room in front of a screen
 and gives commands to a computer that moves the dome and
 telescope. (Large motions in "declination", i.e., latitude,
 are done by hand, however.)
 Also, most observing on that telescope
 is not done by looking through an eyepiece. Instead, the
 incoming light is gathered by a CCD (charge-coupled device)&mdash;a
 digital camera; again, just like all research telescopes.
 There is a way to use eyepieces on the telescope, but that 
 feature is very rarely used.
<!--
(There is a way of using an eyepiece to do some checking, but
 it provides very poor views and is not used for actual observing.)

 None of us work here; we are all volunteers who do this
 because we love looking at things in the heavens, and we
 enjoy learning about the topic and sharing that knowledge

<h3>17A) Who owns this place?</h3>
<h3>17B) How much is this telescope worth?</h3>

<p>Cornell University owns all the facilities on its campus,
 including this building and the equipment in it. The
<a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/">
      Astronomy Department</a>
 is the unit within Cornell that is in charge of
 maintaining the building and the telescope. 
</p>

<p>While it is possible to put some dollar figure on the
 telescope, based on its initial purchase cost
 and computing inflation since then, it really is
 priceless&mdash;they literally do not make them like
 this anymore!

<a name="dome" id="dome"></a>
<h3>18) How do you move/open the dome?</h3>

<p>On the wall just below the dome, to the left as you enter
 from the stairs, is an electric motor that rotates the dome.
 It is the only aspect of observing that is not muscle-powered.
 (There is, however, a photograph from the 1920s, just after
 the installation of the telescope, that shows
 a chain &amp; pulley system where the motor now sits!) When we
 need to rotate the dome, we use a cable control to operate the
 motor. (The motor was replaced a few years ago; before that it used
 to make a <span class="superem">very</span> loud noise when it started
 up, which used to startle people.)
</p>

<p>We would not want to open the entire dome&mdash;in case of
 precipitation, it would be very difficult to close it in time to
 prevent water damage to the telescope. Thus, there is only a
 small slit that is openable. Like everything except the dome
 motor, it is hand-operated; you can see a wheel at the bottom-right
 of the dome-slit. When we open or close for the night, we rotate
 the dome so that the slit is due south (opposite the stairs), climb
 the tall ladder on that side, and hand-crank the wheel.

<h3>19) If the stars are so far away, how do you know if they're still there?</h3>

<p>The short answer: we don't, of course; but it's a <u><b><i>VERY</i></b></u> safe bet.</p>

<p>Because light travels at a finite speed, everything you see is always a little bit
 back in time: the stars, your cat, the teacher in class, etc. For anything
 except astronomical objects, the disparity is on the timescale of microseconds
 because lightspeed is so fast (just under 300,000 kilometers, or 186,282 miles, per
 second). For astronomical objects, however, the distances back in time quickly
 become significant. Once beyond the solar system, you are looking years into the past:
 hundreds, thousands, or millions of years. The light from the next star over, Alpha
 Centauri, takes over four years to reach us; meanwhile, the Pleiades star cluster, a
 winter favorite in the constellation Taurus, is estimated to be about 440 light-years away,
 so Shakespeare was in grade school when that light left. The farthest object visible to the
 naked eye, the Andromeda Galaxy, is about 2.5 million years away at lightspeed: a few
 species before modern humans in evolutionary terms. (Keep in mind that this is "next
 door" on the scale of the universe: if our galaxy is Ithaca, the Andromeda Galaxy is
 Dryden!) Some of the galaxies in a huge galaxy cluster in the spring constellation
 Virgo are on the order of 60-65 million years away by light, so the light you see from
 some of them started its journey while the dinosaurs were still around! (In terms of the
 above Earth distance analogy, this is still only the equivalent of going from Ithaca
 to Rochester!)
</p>

<p>On human timescales, a million years is long enough for <b><i>lots</i></b> of things
 to happen&mdash;all of recorded human history is only about six thousand years, after
 all, and <i>Homo sapiens</i> has only existed as a species for less than 100,000 years
 in total. The timescale of the universe and of stars, however, is so much vaster that
 a million years is hardly anything. Here's the arithmetic: 1) A human who lives 76 years
 will live for approximately 40 million minutes. 2) Our Sun, a completely run-of-the-mill
 star, has been around about five
 billion (=five thousand million) years, and it is only about halfway through its
 expected lifespan. 3) One 40-millionth of 10 billion is 250. So, 250 years is about the
 same to the life of a star as is one minute to a human being's life. If we say (to make
 the arithmetic simpler) that the whole of recorded history is 5000 years, that's the
 equivalent for a star of 20 minutes in a human life. Now think: of all the people you
 walk past in any particular 20 minutes, regardless of their ages, how many of them
 usually drop dead during that timespan? In the same way, we should expect stars to be
 just as stable and stick around&mdash;they are, and do.

<a name="averted" id="averted"></a>
<h3>20A) Are you SURE there's something there? I'm not seeing a thing!</h3>
<h3>20B) What's averted vision?</h3>

<p>If one of us assures you that we've got something in the telescope (and it's not
 obviously big and bright, like the Moon...) but you can't see anything,
 there are two possibilities for what's going wrong. (Assuming the telescope hasn't
 gotten knocked out of alignment, of course!)</p>

<p>The first thing to check is
 that you're looking down the center of the view. The field of view for the various
 eyepieces is actually pretty narrow, especially for the "wide-angle" eyepieces.
 If you look even a little off-center you'll find yourself staring at the inside
 of the telescope. The easiest way to center your view is to make a ring around
 the edge of the eyepiece with your thumb and forefinger, then put your eye up
 to the center of the ring you made.</p>

<p>The second thing is to use averted vision.
 The retina has two basic kinds of receptor cells: rods and cones. Cones process color,
 but they don't work well for low light-levels. Rods work in low light, but they don't do
 color. Since cones are more useful for humans from an evolutionary standpoint (e.g., being
 able to tell by color there's a tiger in those bushes waiting to pounce...), the center
 of your field of vision&mdash;where you're looking straight ahead&mdash;is mostly
 cones. The biggest concentration of rods is along a ring a little ways away from your
 center of vision. Therefore, your best seeing ability at night is a bit off-center;
 looking at something this way is called averted vision.</p>

<p>There is a third thing possible, which unfortunately is not practical: jiggling
 the view. Your brain is <b><i>very</i></b> good at noticing something moving through the visual
 field. (Evolution again: that tiger in the bushes waiting to pounce becomes obvious
 if it paces...) So, a very faint smudge that's difficult to pick out from the background,
 like a galaxy, will likely pop out at you if it's moving through the field of view.
 When we have multiple visitors waiting, though, we simply can't take the time to jiggle
 the view for each person. For showing galaxies to members of the public, we therefore
 stick to ones that are bright enough that jiggling shouldn't be necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, remember that it takes practice to pick out faint fuzzy things if you
 don't know what you're looking for. So don't get discouraged&mdash;come on back
 another night to get some practice!:)</p><br />

<p>(Oh, yes: absolutely none of the above will help in the least if you've just texted
 your friend "im @ obs, c u l8r" on your brightly-lit whatever&mdash;you just finished
<a href="#redlight">blinding yourself</a>
 for the next hour!!)</p>

<h3>21A) Why are stars different colors?</h3>
<h3>21B) I'm told stars are different colors but they almost all look white to me...</h3>
<h3>21C) Why aren't there any green stars?</h3>

<p>All objects give off electromagnetic energy as a function of their temperature. Most
 of the time this energy is not in visible light; for example, plants and animals give
 off energy in the infrared, which is "below" (<i>infra</i>) red light. Objects that are in
 certain temperature ranges give off energy at wavelengths we can see (red, yellow,
 blue...), while even hotter objects emit energy at wavelengths too short for us to see:
 ultraviolet (ultra="beyond, above"), X-ray, etc. (Think about turning on a metal
 burner on an electric stove with the dial all the way up. It starts off cold; soon you
 can feel the heat/infrared, and as it gets hotter you can begin to see it glow red. It
 might get up to an orange with a hint of yellow, depending on the stove. For obvious safety
 reasons it won't get any hotter, but an arc-welding flame is white-hot to blue-hot.)</p>

<p>Now, an object does not emit energy at only a single wavelength/color&mdash;in other words,
 it's not "4000 degrees = red / 4010 degrees = orange / 4020 = yellow," or anything
 like that. Instead, an object emits energy over a range of wavelengths; this is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body">
	black-body radiation</a>.
 So, stars that are cool (relatively speaking!) emit a lot of their radiation around
 red wavelengths, with some towards the yellow and a bunch down in the infrared.
 Betelgeuse, one of Orion's shoulders, is one such star you can easily see during
 Nov.-Mar. (Betelgeuse is so huge that in late 2009 astronomers were actually able to
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html">
	image features on its surface</a>!);
 Antares in Scorpius the Scorpion is another one, visible during June-Sept.
 Stars about as hot as our sun (ca. 6000 degrees Centigrade/11,000 Farenheit) give
 off most light around yellow wavelengths; and <b><i>really</i></b> hot stars like Sirius (about
 50,000 deg. C) give off mostly blue and ultraviolet.</p>

<p>The relative mix of colors that a star emits as its black-body radiation varies
 with temperature. A star
 that's hot enough to give off a lot of green light also gives off a lot of blue, red,
 and yellow light as well. When you look at such a star, your eye integrates (blends)
 all that color information together, so it comes out white. Hence, no green stars.</p>

<p>As for why most stars look white, this has to do with the structure of your eye.
 The retina has two basic kinds of receptor cells: rods and cones. Cones process color,
 but they don't work well for low light-levels. Rods work in low light, but they don't do
 color. When you're looking at stars it's obviously a low-light situation, so you're
 using almost exlusively rods. Thus, unless a star is giving off nearly all its visible
 light in, say, the red, enough that your cones can tell your brain, "Yo&mdash;red,
 dude!", you're basically only getting rod info, i.e., black + white. (To the extent
 that there appears to be a bluish tinge to the white, you're seeing the background
 glow of the sky.)</p>

<a name="coolness" id="coolness"></a>
<h3>22) Wow, this is SOooo cool; how can I become an astronomer?</h3>

<p>First off, we're glad you agree that astronomy is cool&mdash;<i>we</i> certainly
think it is!</p>

<p>To be a professional astronomer, you need good math and physics grades,
 of course&mdash;but then, <i>everyone</i> should know something about math and
 physics!:) Depending on what part of astronomy most interests you,
 you'll also need to study other subjects: meteorology for planetary
 atmospheres, geology for asteroids and planetary surfaces, and so forth.
 (Oh, and astronomy courses in general, too.:)</p>

<p>However, you don't need to become a professional astronomer in order to
 do astronomy, either just because you like it or because you want to
 contribute to science. Thanks to the Internet, dirt-cheap computing
 power, and the availability of relatively inexpensive telescopes with
 excellent optics, we are now in a new Golden Age&trade; for amateurs to
 contribute to astronomy. So, it's possible to have a "regular" career
 in some other field and contribute to astronomy on the side.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why amateurs can help professional astronomers.
 First off, there are not enough professional astronomers and research
 telescopes/satellites to scan the entire sky all the time. Thus,
 amateurs tend to find most comets, lots of asteroids, and a lot of
 supernovas (exploding stars) in other galaxies. Amateurs are also
 the only group with enough time and numbers to keep track of
 variable stars (stars that change in brightness). As the
<a href="http://www.aavso.org/">
	American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO)</a>
 says about itself:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 5%">
  Membership in the AAVSO is open to anyone&mdash;professionals, amateurs,
  and educators alike&mdash;interested in variable stars and in contributing
  to the support of valuable research. Professional astronomers have
  neither the time nor the telescopes needed to gather data on the
  brightness changes of thousands of variables, and amateurs make a real
  and useful contribution to science by observing variable stars and
  submitting their observations to the AAVSO International Database.</p>

<p>The second reason amateurs can help professional astronomers: as hard
 as this might be to believe, there aren't enough computers to analyze
 all the data that come in. Also, there are some tasks like shape
 recognition and classification where computers are really lousy while
 humans are superb. These have led to multiple projects
 where you don't even need to know math/physics/etc. to help: the two
 most famous such are the
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">
	SETI@Home</a>
 and the
<a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/">
	Galaxy Zoo</a>
 projects. You can
<a href="#seti_home">
	read a bit more about the SETI@Home project here</a>,
 and you can
<a href="#gal_zoo">
	read a bit more about the Galaxy Zoo project here</a>.
</p>

<p>So, there are a lot of ways you can contribute to astronomy--go for it!:)</p>

<a href="#top">Back to the Table of Contents</a>
<hr />

<a name="seti_home" id="seti_home"></a>
<h3>Tell me about the SETI@Home project, please.</h3>

SETI stands for "<b><i>S</i></b>earch for <b><i>E</i></b>xtra<b><i>T</i></b>errestrial
 <b><i>I</i></b>ntelligence."
 Radio telescopes scan the skies in multiple radio bandwidths. If a
 section of radio data appears to have some sort of structure to it
 instead of being a generic hiss, that might be a potential radio
 signal generated by another civilization. (Obviously, false alarms
 caused by Earth aircraft, satellites, cell-phones, etc. need to be
 weeded out first! There are also other naturally-occuring regular
 radio signals, caused by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar">
	pulsars</a>,
 that need to be eliminated as well.)</p>

<p>There is a <i>lot</i> of radio data to go through, more than professionals
 have the computing power to analyze. SETI@Home was developed as a
 way to let the public help with the analysis. In effect, it creates
 an immensely big and powerful computer made up of thousands of small
 personal computers, each analyzing tiny chunks of radio data.</p>

<p>SETI@Home simply needs you to 1) leave your home computer turned on and
 connected to the Internet, and 2) download some software that connects
 your computer to the project. At the times when your screensaver would
 kick in as the computer goes idle, the software starts up the SETI@Home
 application: it requests a chunk of data from the project (taken from
 radio telescope surveys of the sky) and analyzes it for a possible signal
 from a civlization elsewhere in the galaxy. So far they haven't found
 anything; but there is a HUGE amount of data to be processed, on a scale
 that really wants a few million computers working in parallel for years
 to get through. So, here's something you can do to help even while you're
 asleep!:)</p>

<p>(Several other computationally-intensive projects, modeled
 after SETI@Home, have started up, including a
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">
	search for large prime numbers</a>...)</p>

<a href="#coolness">Back to the main question</a><br />
<a href="#top">Back to the Table of Contents</a>
<hr />

<a name="gal_zoo" id="gal_zoo"></a>
<h3>Tell me about the Galaxy Zoo project, please.</h3>

<p>Galaxy Zoo is a project to classify galaxies, using thousands of volunteers
 around the world to look at pictures. It is like the SETI@Home project in
 that it involves using thousands of people's computers in parallel, but it
 differs because <b><i>you</i></b>, not your computer, are directly doing the analytical
 work.</p>

<p>Galaxy Zoo arose from the
<a href="http://www.sdss.org">
	Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>
 project. SDSS is a automated survey of one quarter of the entire sky that
 has to date resulted
 in over a million images of galaxies. There is no way the professionals could
 ever sort through that many pictures; and computers are really stupid when
 it comes to image classifcation. In contrast, people are superb at identifying
 features in images because of how evolution has shaped brains over the
 last few hundred million years. So, the professionals enlisted the help of
 everyday people around the world. You sign up, go through a short
 tutorial on how to do a basic classification of a galaxy (is its shape
 spiral/round/other, how many arms does it have if it's spiral, etc.), and
 have at it.</p>

<p>GalaxyZoo has been <i>VERY</i> popular. Over 250,000 people have participated, and
 their work has already led to several very interesting discoveries;
<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080625.html">
	Hanny's Voorwerp</a>
 (pronounced "FOOR-vurp") is the most striking
 example. Hanny van Arkel is a young Dutch teacher who heard about
 the first phase of the Galaxy Zoo project and signed up to help. About
 a week after she began helping to sort images of galaxies she did the
 equivalent of winning the lottery: she classified a galaxy then noticed
 something weird on the image, and posted it to their feedback forum
 asking, "What's the blue stuff? Anybody?" Turned out not only didn't
 anyone know, it was something nobody'd heard of before: it's
 a galaxy-sized cloud of gas, glowing very strongly in only certain
 colors (to a human eye it would be bright green, but the original image
 had been false-color and thus blue), apparently being lit up by
 the galaxy near it in the image, and has a huge empty hole through
 it. The object became known as Hanny's Voorwerp (Dutch for "object"),
 and Ms. van Arkel is now a minor astronomy celebrity and has acquired a
 part-time side job as an astronomy outreach educator.</p>

<p>
An
<a href="http://www.hannysvoorwerp.com/?page_id=76">
	animation</a>,
 taken from a Powerpoint presentation,
 gives a very simple explanation of the Voorwerp in lay person's terms,
 based on what is known as of January, 2010. Meanwhile, an
<a href="http://blogs.zooniverse.org/galaxyzoo/2008/03/20/voorwerp-fever/">
	explanation at the Galaxy Zoo site</a>
 has a few of the technical details behind the animation.
 The Hubble Telescope is scheduled to take
 some images of the Voorwerp in 2010, and several astronomers are
 including it in their research programs. Ms. van Arkel maintains a 
<a href="http://www.hannysvoorwerp.com">
	website about developments in the Galaxy Zoo and the Voorwerp</a>,
 remains an avid volunteer with the project, and as of Sept. 2009 became
 one of the moderators of a new forum for astronomy outreach and gender
 equality issues in the sciences, the
<a href="http://forum.sheisanastronomer.org">
	She Is An Astronomer</a>
 forum.</p>

<p>Less spectacular but just as noteworthy are the
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/07/27/galaxy-zoo-discovers-new-group-of-galaxies-green-peas/">
	"Green Peas."</a>
 These are a
 group of small round galaxies all more or less the same distance away on
 the galactic scale of things,
 and all of which look greenish&mdash;i.e., like peas. Now, green is not a
 color one sees in stars, much less galaxies

(<a href="#spectra">here's an explanation of star colors</a>);
 so a few people who'd noticed the things (including Hanny van Arkel)
 also posted to the feedback forum, which made
 others keep a better watch out for them, and made them notice others,
 and... Thanks to the members of the "Peas Corps," there's now a first
 paper in the peer-review process (as of Sept. 2009). While the paper
 was written up by the pros, it lists these amateurs as contributors.
 The Peas appear to be a new subclass of galaxies with very high levels
 of star formation. Their green color comes from having a huge amount
 of a particular type of ionized oxygen. When oxygen is ionized in a
 certain way, it gives off the specific color of green light seen in
 these galaxies and nothing else. This type of ionization tends to occur in
 gas clouds where new stars are being formed; that these entire galaxies
 appear green implies that there is a LOT of star formation going on
 in them.</p>

<p>In late 2009, several related projects were added to the Galaxy Zoo;
 the entire suite is now whimsically called
<a href="http://zooniverse.org/">
 "The Zooniverse."</a>
 One project asks people to look for supernovas (incredibly bright exploding stars)
 in galaxy images. A second project asks people to run simulations of
 merging and interacting galaxies: you're given an image of two interacting
 galaxies and several simulations, and if one or more of the simulations
 look at all like the image, you can play around to see if you can get
 them to look more like the image. In this way, astronomers hope to
 understand better the dynamics of galaxy mergers. (A stunning composite image
 of various interacting galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo is at the
<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap091026.html">
	Astronomy Picture of the Day [APOD]<a/>
 website for Oct. 26th, 2009&mdash;the "letters" in the name at lower right are
 unaltered images of interacting galaxies, by the way.:) More projects will
 almost certainly be added to the Zooinverse in coming
 years, giving members of the public ever more opportunities to help
 professional scientists.</p>

<a href="#coolness">Back to the main question</a><br />
<a href="#top">Back to the Table of Contents</a>
<hr />

<a name="ufo2" id="ufo2"></a>
<h3>ZZZ) Why don't you believe in UFOs? Don't you think there's
 intelligent life on other planets?</h3>

<p>Those are two completely different questions. To answer the
 second one first: while there is no evidence as yet of any life,
 never mind intelligent life, elsewhere in the universe, we
 certainly hope that there is. As the saying from the film
 <span class="title">Contact</span> goes, "If there weren't,
 it would be an awfully
 big waste of space." There are ongoing efforts to listen for
 signals from extra-terrestrial civilizations; you can aid these
 efforts by joining the
<a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">
      SETI@home Project</a>.
</p>

<p>Re the first question: once you get some conception of the size of
 space, it is obvious that the idea that multiple small-scale
 (20-60 meter) "manned" spacecraft have, during the last 50-odd
 years, repeatedly come to <em>this</em> particular planet in <em>this</em>
 particular mediocre out-of-the-way planetary system, is
 ludicrous to the point of being delusional. Space is just
 tooooooooooooooo big for a ship to carry sufficient provisions
 and fuel to traverse interstellar space, slow down to do
 detailed exploration, speed up to go home, and slow down again
 when it gets there. The scale is beyond anything whatsoever in
 human experience.
</p>

<p>Here's one way to view the size of things. One of the most
 famous pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope is an image
 called
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/1995/44/">
	"The Pillars of Creation,"</a>
 a <em>very small</em> portion of the Eagle
 Nebula, in the constellation Serpens Cauda (the Snake's
 Tail). The section visible of the leftmost column is estimated to be
 approximately the distance from our solar system to the next
 star over, Alpha Centauri. At the top of the column are a few
 tiny pimple-like protrusions. On that scale, each of those is over 2500 times
 as wide as the distance from the Earth to the Sun. The two Voyager probes, the
 fastest human-made objects ever until the New Horizons probe
 was launched in January, 2006, have taken <em>over thirty years to go
 less than <span class="superem">1/25th</span> the width</em> of one of those
 protrusions&mdash;and this was with over 99%
 of their initial mass being used as a propulsion system that was
 immediately discarded.
</p>

<p>Another way to get an appreciation for the scale of things, in
 a visceral, personal way, is to do the Sagan Memorial Planet Walk
 downtown from the Commons out to the Sciencenter out by Route 13,
 a little more than a mile. (And the
<a href="http://www.sciencenter.org/">
      Sciencenter</a>
 is a cool place
 to visit in any case.) On the Planet Walk's scale, the stele for
 the next star, Alpha Centauri, would be in Honolulu! So think how
 long it would take you to walk non-stop to Hawaii (ignoring such
 details as having to walk on water for the last 2000 miles...);
 and remember that in traversing the Planet Walk at a typical
 walking speed, you are doing the equivalent of going some 15-20
 times faster than the speed of light! (Sunlight takes over 5 hours
 to reach Pluto. Time yourself to walk from the Sun stele to the
 Earth stele; light needs about 500 seconds to go from the Sun to
 the Earth, so divide 500 by your time to get your "solar-system hyperdrive"
 velocity.)

<p>If you try to bring up "Well, so what about warp-drives like on
 <span class="title">Star Trek</span>?", here's a Trek example. The 
 book <span class="title">The Making of Star Trek</span> (Stephen 
 Whitfield &amp; Gene Roddenberry; repr., NY: Ballantine Books, 1986) 
 states that the fastest safe speed
 for the ship, warp six, was 216 times the speed of light; going
 faster risked serious structural damage. This would make for a
 7-day transit time to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star&mdash;a little
 longer than an Atlantic crossing would take for a steamship like
 the <span class="title">Titanic</span> (had it not sunk, of course...).
 One episode takes the Enterprise to a mining outpost on the planet
 Rigel 12. The star Rigel is estimated to be something like 800 light-years away.
 This means that if the Enterprise went straight from Sol to Rigel
 at top speed with no stops or side trips at all, it would have
 taken nearly four years of their "five-year mission" just for <em>one</em>
 episode (never mind getting back!).

<p>For an excellent discussion about the engineering challenges
 for <span class="superem">real</span> interstellar travel,
 read Paul Gilster's <span class="title">Centauri Dreams: Imagining
 and Planning Interstellar Exploration</span>
 (NY: Copernicus Books, 2004). Gilster does a serious, detailed
 technical analysis of the issues involved in sending an unmanned
 probe to Alpha Centauri on a human-lifetime scale (75-100 years),
 and shows, based on interviews with experts in the various fields
 involved, where current technology stands compared to what would
 be needed. Gilster maintains a
<a href="http://www.centauri-dreams.org/">
      Centauri Dreams website</a>
 with updates on space science issues and relevant technological
 innovations, to foster discussion about when interstellar probes
 might become feasible.
