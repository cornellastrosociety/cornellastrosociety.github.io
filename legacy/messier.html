<h2>Messier Marathon 2008</h2>

<p>The gods were apparently determined that CAS not be able to do a
 2008 Messier marathon. During the new moon window early in the month,
 Art and Mike began <a href="log.html#Mess_try1">an attempt on the evening
 of Sun. the 9th</a>&mdash;it
 started all right despite the need to do joint operation of the telescope
 due to the broken R.A. locking knob, but clouds shut them down by 10pm.
 On Monday the 24th, Art noticed the sky had cleared at sunset and decided
 to try as much of a marathon as possible before moonrise, only to find
 upon reaching the observatory that an Astro 102 lab was taking place and
 would not get done until late enough that the early evening objects would
 mostly be too low. Two days later, a third attempt was stopped before
 ever starting by clouds moving in <i><b>exactly</b></i> at sunset after a
 completely clear day.</p>

<p>Art made one last attempt on Sat. the 29th, a good clear, but extremely
 cold, night. As with last year's marathon,
 only the 40mm wide-angle lens was used as being a "faster" eyepiece, i.e.,
 objects like the Crab Nebula that are nearly impossible to see in regular
 eyepieces are definitely visible, if faint, in it. Also like last year, as
 many non-Messiers as practical were to be located, to take the place of
 those objects too washed out by light pollution or otherwise unable to be
 seen. (In particular, no attempt was made to find Ms 74/77/33/110.) Finally,
 Art hoped that time could be gained by getting as many
 evening objects in binoculars as possible.</p>

<p>Although the evening began with what seemed an auspicious omen (a
 magnificent pass of the ISS almost overhead just after 8pm), the attempt
 was defeated, primarily by equipment problems. Well over an hour was
 lost when the dome became stuck at the bad dead spot in the northwest while
 attempting to get M52, M76, et al. Mike very generously left an event he was
 covering for Cornell Cinema to help get the dome moving again&mdash;he should
 therefore get joint credit on the marathon such as it was, since the attempt
 would have died right then otherwise. However, the concern was that
 any other attempt to get the circumpolar objects would again risk a dome
 seizure due to another known dead spot in the northeast; thus, another dozen
 targets had to be abandoned. Growing haze at low altitude prevented M83 and M61
 from being found, even with a good bit of effort. Finally, as the night
 progressed, the R.A. calibration wheel began to stick, presumably from the
 cold. By 2am, it had reached the point that further locating would have to be
 done either by recalibrating the wheel for each target, or else by strict
 star-hopping without any reference to the R.A. wheel. As he was experiencing
 bad back pain by then, he finally conceded defeat to the gods just after 2:30am,
 having logged 44 Messier objects and 11 non-Messiers.</p>

<p>
Here is the log of objects and the time found. Non-Messier objects are ordered
 by letters. Observations marked "bin" were made with the 11x80 binoculars; all
 others were made with the 12-inch refractor.</p>
