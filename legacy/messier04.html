<h2>Messier Marathon 2004</h2>

<script type="text/javascript">
writeMessierMenu();
</script>

<p> The first Messier marathon event (in recent history) of CAS was attempted
on March 22/23 at the Fuertes observatory. The instruments used were the
12-inch refractor and a 11 x 80 binocular. The people who participated in
the event are Guanhan, Jagadheep, J.R and Krzysztof. </p>

<p> The event was a major success, and we found a total of 94 objects out of
110 by 4:00 am. Unfortunately, after that, clouds rolled in and so we had
to abandon the observing. If it were not for the clouds, there was a
pretty good chance that we might have pushed the object tally to 100. </p>

<p> The following is the log of objects found (sorted in order of when each
was found) along with the person who found it. Objects found using the
binoculars are marked as "bin" (other objects found using the telescope). </p>

<p> At this point, the south-east sky (which was the location of remaining
objects) was completely clouded up, and so we had to stop. </p>

<h3>Missing objects</h3>

<p> M74 and M33 were washed out by the surface brightness of the sky (the
western sky and north-western sky are quite severely light polluted thanks
to the city of Ithaca and north campus of Cornell). Considering the
failure to detect M33 even through the finderscope, we did not attempt
M110. M79 was behind trees and so unobservable through the telescope. The
south-eastern sky turned out to be too bright for it to be detected in
binoculars. M78 seemed to be a marginal detection, but since neither of us
were absolutely sure that it was not a figment of our imagination, it was
not included in the final tally. The objects we missed due to the sky
clouding up were M28, M69, M70, M54, M55, M75, M15, M2, M72, M73 and M30. </p>

<h3>Other comments</h3>

<p> Krzysztof was there in the group from about 8:30 pm to 11:00 pm. During
telescope observations, J.R and Krzysztof (when present) were providing
invaluable support by constantly moving the dome and periodically winding
the weights for the tracking mechanism. So though they did not use the
telescope and hence find objects through the telescope, they share credit
for all objects found through the telescope. </p>
