<h2>Orion With Clouds</h2>

<p>Still another work of art from our very own Mike Roman. Mike stayed up 
until 3:30 AM to catch this winter constellation in September. In addition to 
Orion, you can see Sirius in the lower left corner (notice how Orion's belt 
almost points toward it). Sirius is the brightest star in Canis Major, the 
larger of Orion's two hunting dogs, and in fact the brightest star in the 
entire sky. It is also one of the nearest stars at only 8.6 light years away. 
There are only four stars closer, and of those only one, Alpha 
Centauri, is visible without binoculars or a telescope.</p>

<!--
<p>For those who were wondering, the four closer stars are Alpha Centauri, 
Barnard's Star, CN Leonis (sci-fi writers prefer Wolf 359), and HD 95735 
(a.k.a. Lalande 21185).</p>
