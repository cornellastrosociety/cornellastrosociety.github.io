<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2011</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Chinese Astronomy Part II – The Modern Chinese Space Program</p>
<p class="presenter">Hua Liu</p>
<p class="abstract">China's meteoric rise into the ranks of the world's most advanced nations comes hand in hand with its desire to break the confines of the atmosphere and venture into the final frontier. A latecomer to the space club dominated by more senior organizations like NASA, the Chinese National Space Administration had to expand quickly as not to get sidelined, while constantly adapting to a changing political climate. Join us for Part II of "Chinese Astronomy" as we tour the Modern Chinese Space Program: from its humble and controversial beginnings, to the modern entity that reflects Chinese technological and economical might.

<p class="title">Neptune Then and Now </p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">The planet Neptune is unique among solar system objects in that it was discovered by means of mathematics (and some luck...:). Discrepancies in the position of the planet Uranus led to a calculated orbit for another planet that was perturbing it, and Neptune was observed on Sept. 23, 1846, within one degree of the predicted position. On July 12, 2011, Neptune finally completed one orbit around the Sun since its discovery. To mark the occasion, in this talk we'll look at the story of its discovery and what has been learned about it through Voyager 2's 1989 flyby and observations from the Hubble Telescope.

<p class="title"> Stellar Evolution - the birth and life of a star</p>
<p class="presenter">Bryan Scherrer</p>
<p class="abstract">
Much is said in popular culture about the deaths of stars. Black holes are popular (and extremely misunderstood) standards in modern culture. But what about what happened before the black hole? What of the innumerable stars that don't even have the chance of becoming black hole? Those are the times that are truly fascinating. Join us at Fuertes Observatory to learn about the lives of the stars.

<p class="title"> Exoplanets - Highlights from the Frontier of Detectability</p>
<p class="presenter">Everett Schlawin</p>
<p class="abstract">
While we have long pondered the existence of extrasolar planets, astronomers only had the instruments and survey sizes to begin finding them beginning in the early 1990s. Since this time, the newest exoplanet finds have appeared in abundance behind an envelope set by instrument precision. The rapid progression of this curtain has unveiled hundreds of exoplanets in the last decade from highly eccentric Jovian planets to tidally stretched planets to super Earths to planets in the habitable zones of their host stars. This talk highlights some of the newest results on exoplanet finds and exoplanet atmospheres that have been uncovered mostly correctly and sometimes incorrectly at the frontier.

<p class="title">SOFIA - NASA's Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy </p>
<p class="presenter">Yoni Saltzman</p>
<p class="abstract">
For centuries, astronomers have relied on ground-based telescopes to view the universe. However, over the last two decades, space-based telescopes have helped to propel science to amazing new heights (literally). Yet space-based telescopes are enormously expensive and extremely hard to service. Over the last 18 months, the gap between ground-based and space-based telescopes has been bridged by NASA's new airborne Stratospheric Observatory. Inside this modified 747 is a 2.5 meter telescope that has already made an uncountable number of amazing discoveries. Come learn everything imaginable about one of astronomy's newest and greatest telescopes. Meet a student researcher who worked at NASA and flew on SOFIA this past summer. View never-before-seen images of the interior of the SOFIA aircraft and ask questions regarding astronomical research that has only recently been available to the general public.

<p class="title"> Los Alamos National Laboratory in Space</p>
<p class="presenter">Erik Edelmann</p>
<p class="abstract">
This lecture will be about Los Alamos National Laboratory's contribution to the space program. They have assisted in many NASA projects (usually for power systems) and have had their own projects, usually based on satellite systems and construction.

<p class="title"> Music of the Spheres and other Ancient and Early Medieval conceptions of Celestial Harmony </p>
<p class="presenter">Lorraine Fitzmaurice</p>
<p class="abstract">
Most people have heard the phrase 'the music of the spheres' at some point, whether with regard to a vague sense of order and beauty of the cosmos or pieces of music based upon such a concept like Holst's Suite The Planets. But what does the phrase actually mean, and where does it come from? What does music have to do with math and astronomy? Join me as we dig through Medieval manuscripts to find out this Friday at Fuertes Observatory.

<p class="title">Space Suits: What Keeps You Alive While Hurtling Through Space</p>
<p class="presenter">Daniel Rocio</p>
<p class="abstract">Space suits have been seen as a symbol of the manned space program, though they have not always had their famous backpack and round helmet design, nor will they always. There are also many considerations that go into the design that give the space suit its iconic appearance including breathability and temperature. But what are the issues when you try to give somebody a portable atmosphere? Come, learn and find out.</p>

<p class="title">Titan & Enceladus</p>
<p class="presenter">Michael Hammer</p>
<p class="abstract">
Saturn has long captivated people with its vast ring system, but also in orbit are 62 moons of various different shapes and sizes. Towards the end of the last century, NASA launched the Cassini-Huygens mission to study Saturn and some of its larger moons in depth. In the 7 years it has been orbit, Cassini has made some shocking discoveries, most notably on Titan—the 2nd largest moon in the solar system, and on Enceladus—the most reflective object in the solar system. Join me this Friday, as we’ll explore these exciting new discoveries and the features of these moons that make them surprisingly resemble Earth itself.
