<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2006</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required.</p>

<p class="title">The Death of Stars</p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">All stars must come to an end. However, the death of a star 
is often a beginning for new stars, planets, and (in at least one case) even 
life. This lecture explores the last step of the stellar life cycle and the 
fate of different types of stars in the universe. What causes a star to blow 
up? What happens afterwards? Find out about types of supernovae, white dwarfs, 
brown dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. How is the end of the stellar 
life cycle crucial for the genesis of life? Are we really made of stardust? 
Finally, take yourself five billion years into the future when the sun will 
expand, ending all life on Earth.</p>

<p class="title">Space: The Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, <em>REALLY</em> Big Picture</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">As Bill Bryson has written, "Space is extremely well named."
Astronomical distances are completely beyond our human experience;
in this talk we will try, however inadequately, to put some
personal sense of perspective back in the picture. To do so,
audience members are requested to time themselves on one or both
of the following beforehand: 1) run 100 meters (the length of an
American football field plus one endzone); 2) on the Sagan Memorial
Planet Walk on the Commons, walk from the Sun stele to the Earth
stele. (Walking the entire 1.2 km out to the Pluto stele and
visiting the Sciencecenter would also be a good thing!) We will
run some numbers --anonymously!!!-- vis-a-vis various distances
to see how long it would take us to actually get anywhere in the
universe. As a followup, we will examine some ways astronomers
have measured any of these distances, given that we are (for any
real purpose) stuck in one spot.</p>

<p class="title">Running the Messier Marathon<br />Or, the Fun of Pulling an All-Nighter 
on a School/Work Night to Look for Faint, Fuzzy Blobs of Light in the Sky.</p>
<p class="presenter">Mike Roman, Art Samplaski, and Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">In the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a list of over
100 deep-sky objects to help comet hunters avoid false alarms. In the late 1970s, 
it was realized that there is a window in late March when it is possible to view 
(nearly) all the Messier objects in a single dusk-to-dawn marathon. Several CAS 
members will hold a panel discussion about Messier, the types of objects in his 
catalogue, and how you too can partake in this very different type of marathon.</p>

<p class="title">The History of Fuertes Observatory</p>
<p class="presenter">Jennifer Bailard and Shianne Beer</p>
<p class="abstract">Everyone knows how fascinating planets, stars, and 
galaxies can be, but what of the building and telescope used to view these 
astronomical wonders? Jennifer Bailard and Shianne Beer will discuss the 
history of observatories at Cornell University, especially the history behind 
the curious yet beloved Fuertes Observatory. If you love Fuertes half as 
much as Jennifer and Shianne, this is a lecture you'll not want to miss!</p>

<p class="title">Where Did We Come From? What we Know of the Origins of Stars and Planets</p>
<p class="presenter">Krzysztof Findeisen</p>
<p class="abstract">How do scientists know about the formation of the Earth and the solar system? How 
complete is that knowledge? In this talk we will explore both the standard model of solar system 
formation and the process of scientific inquiry that led to it. We will finish off 
with a look at how recent observations are putting pressure on star formation theory, 
and what it all means for the existence of Earthlike planets elsewhere in the universe.</p>
