<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2010</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Who wants to be an Amateur Astronomer - The Grand Finale</p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">Back due to popular demand. This lecture brings you the grand finale for the CAS lecture series Game Show special edition started last fall. "Who was the first astronomer to discover an object outside Milky Way Galaxy?" "How long is a sidereal day?" "Which moon in the solar system is believed to have a subsurface ocean? What does Dyson Sphere harvest?" These are only some of the questions from the previous episode of 'Who wants to be an Amateur Astronomer'. Last time, one of our contestants managed to survive through all but final question, missing his chance forever to win ONE MILLION DOLLARS*. If you think you've got what it takes, join us and answer 15 questions correctly to win ONE MILLION DOLLARS*. If you don't think you've got what it takes, join us as part of the audience and lend aid to our contestants as they falter under pressure.
<br>
<br>
Will the record still hold? Will there be a new challenger who is able to bring down the CAS special lecture final challenge? Or will this grand challenge be over without a real victor?
<br>
<br>
Let me see the hands for... Who wants to be an Amateur Astronomer?

<p class="title">Messieur Messier and His Marathon </p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">One of 18th c. French astronomer Charles Messier's job duties was
to look for comets, but he and his assistant Pierre M&eacute;chain kept
finding non-moving faint fuzzy things. The "Messier catalogue"
they compiled is now famous as the cr&egrave;me-de-la-cr&egrave;me list of star
clusters, galaxies, etc. of the northern sky. Come learn a little
about Messier, the deep-sky objects in his catalogue, and "Messier
marathons," an increasingly popular activity for astronomy clubs,
where people try to see all 110 Messier objects in a single all-
night observing session. If the weather permits, immediately after
the talk you can go upstairs to see a few of Messr. Messier's objects.</p>

<p class="title"> Physics of Star Trek</p>
<p class="presenter">Lisa Bacis</p>
<p class="abstract">
Have you ever wondered where you go when Scotty beams you up, what
really happens at warp speed, or why the Enterprise needs those
dilithium crystals? Well, all that and more will be answered as we
take you on a journey through space and time and boldly go where no
Cornellian has gone before.

<p class="title"> The Other Astronomers</p>
<p class="presenter">Kim-Yen Nguyen & Ashlee Wilkins</p>
<p class="abstract">Astronomy is not limited to the Mars rovers and black
 holes and dark energy you see on the news.  Most astronomers spend their
 entire careers pursuing other cosmological questions that often do not
 make the local headlines but that are no less instrumental to understanding
 the universe.  Addressing topics from the Paradox of Youth to cosmic strings,
 every question astronomers seek to answer is one more step towards unraveling
 the deepest secrets of the universe.  In a tribute to the everyday astronomer,
 we will provide a brief survey of current research in astronomy that is just
 as interesting as microscopic black holes in particle colliders.  To all the
 Albert Einstein- and Carl Sagan-esque stars of astronomy, we salute you for
 your incomparable genius.  But to all the other astronomers: we salute you,
 too, for your own brilliance in the work you do every day. </p>

<p class="title"> Life On Mars: Adventures at the Mars Desert Research Station </p>
<p class="presenter">Mary Beth Wilhelm</p>
<p class="abstract">Come find out what life is like at simulated Martian Habitat!
 Wilhelm will discuss her adventures at the Mars Desert 
Research Station in the southeastern Utah desert this winter:
 battling failing generators, freezing temperatures, hunting
 for extreme microorganisms, and launching areal mapping blimps...all
 while staying 'in simulation.'</p>

<p class="title"> Astronomy and the Origin of Life</p>
<p class="presenter">Hua Liu</p>
<p class="abstract">The origin of life has always been a topic of much controversy, and many hypotheses were made regarding the first formation of life on the primordial earth. This lecture seeks to explore how prevailing theories try to rationalize the origin of life, and the role celestial objects played within these mechanistical explanations - from the hypothesis relating to the formation of the first organic compounds, to the very first coming of life itself.</p>

<p class="title"> Astronomy Jeopardy  </p>
<p class="presenter">Brian Crandall</p>
<p class="abstract">Hello Astronomy fans! Do you have an affinity to star spectral classes? Know who Clyde Tombaugh is? Perhaps you're familiar with Voyagers, Pioneers and Mariners? If so, then come on down and show off your smarts in Astronomy Jeopardy. With such categories as "When Worlds Collide", "Rings You Can't Wear" and "Probing Questions", see if you can outdo other contestants (and nail that Daily Double) to be the ultimate Astronomy Jeopardy champion! Multiple games with different question sets will be played.

Let's see if you have what it takes to make it to top.</p>

<p class="title">Dark Matter</p>
<p class="presenter">Stephen Demjanenko</p>
<p class="abstract">Several astronomical observations suggest that there is a large amount
of unseen (Dark) matter in our universe.  Several theories have been
developed to account of this extra matter and tests are underway to
try and detect it here on Earth.  This lecture will discuss the need
for dark matter as well as what it could possibly be.  Recent results
from several experiments will be presented.</p>

<p class="date">April 23</p>
<p class="title"> Stellar Distances </p>
<p class="presenter">Bryan Scherrer</p>
<p class="abstract">Distance across planet Earth is a simple thing. The most crude
measurement, simply traveling the distance, is an accurate way to
measure the space between two points. How is this done across
spacetime? Come and learn about the various trigonometric methods used
to define distance across space, and the full spectrum of tools
astronomers use to measure distances in the universe.</p>
