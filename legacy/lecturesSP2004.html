<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2004</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required.</p>
