<h2>Messier Marathon 2007</h2>

<script type="text/javascript">

</script>

<p>The new moon during the 2007 Messier marathon window coincided with
the beginning of Cornell's spring break, so student members could participate
without worry about classes the next day. After a pathetic aborted attempt the
evening of the new moon, Sunday the 18th (three objects in 45 minutes by
which time it had clouded over entirely, after a completely clear day), we
began again on Tuesday the 20th and were rewarded beyond all expectations.
It was completely clear all night, with as close to perfect seeing for Fuertes as
possible, considering that we managed to our astonishment to see M&nbsp;110.
While it was very cold (between zero and five degrees Farenheit) such that
several breaks were needed, there was, thankfully, no real wind; and the
slight breeze was from the east, so that steam from the Cornell heating plant
to the south was always blown into areas where we had already finished.</p>

<p>Participating were Mike, Art, Kim, Shianne, Jennifer, Lisa, Brian, and
Dounan. While only the first three named actually found objects and only
Mike and Art stayed to the end, the others helped with dome-moving and
clockdrive-winding, as well as providing moral support by their presence in
the downstairs classroom. They therefore all should be considered to get
credit for the marathon. Newest (and youngest-ever) CAS keyholder Kim was
especially gung-ho and deserves particular mention: she found many of the
early evening binoculars-class objects; stayed up in the dome to study by red
flashlight when not directly helping, rather than seeking the warmth of
downstairs; and might well have stayed all night had she not had to leave ca.
1:30 due to a Visiting Parental Presence&trade;. (In fairness, her mom very
generously provided several home-cooked meals to CAS members while
visiting. :) March 21st being J. S. Bach's birthday, the overnight classical music
radio show also provided spirit-lifting music in the dome, while a variety of
"alternate programming" was available downstairs. :)</p>

<p>We had decided to use only the wide-angle 40mm eyepiece since it is "faster,"
i.e., objects like the Crab Nebula that are nearly impossible to see in regular
eyepieces are definitely visible, if faint, in it. This proved an excellent strategy.
Second, since we intended not even to try for the faintest evening objects due
to light pollution, we determined to bag various non-Messier NGC objects to
compensate. Some of these were deliberate side trips (e.g., the Owl Cluster,
NGC&nbsp;457), some were logical fallout while finding M-objects (e.g., M&nbsp;51's
companion, NGC&nbsp;5195), and others were various galaxies that Mike tripped
over while doing the Virgo cluster. (Our final, unsuccessful, attempt was the
Saturn Nebula, NGC&nbsp;7009, in lieu of M&nbsp;30; we gave up at 6:30&nbsp;AM.)</p>

<p>There was one minor equipment problem&mdash;a worse-than-usual dead
spot in the dome that required manual assistance to the dome
motor&mdash;and one major equipment problem: the right ascension
locking knob began seizing up (presumably due to cold) and entirely failed by
2:30am. As a result, for the last four hours we had to dial in the R. A. of
objects using the
<a href="/CAS/ptour/bb5.html">"ship's helm"</a>
for flipping the telescope. Most
of those finds required joint operation of the telescope, with Mike or Art
operating the helm for R. A. panning while the other stayed at the eyepiece
and panned in Decl.
</p>

<p>
Here is the log of objects, the time found, and the person doing so. Non-
Messier objects are ordered by letters. Observations marked "-bin" were made
with the 11x80 binoculars; all others were made with the 12-inch refractor.
"M/A" indicates finds made by Mike and Art jointly operating the telescope.

<p>
We took too long on the initial telescopic objects so that M&nbsp;52 had gotten
extremely low. We therefore had to take 10 minutes to go back for it just
before the final pre-dawn targets&mdash;an object lesson not to be leisurely
in a Messier marathon! Otherwise, we did excellently, bagging 103 of 110
Messier objects and an extra 19 NGCs. That M-object count is likely almost as
good as theoretically possible from Ithaca, given the light pollution. Of the
early evening objects, M&nbsp;74 and M&nbsp;33 are too dim. In the morning, 
M&nbsp;30 is too low at dawn ever to be seen, and M&nbsp;72/M&nbsp;73 might 
also be impossible due to <a href="log2006.html#m72bad">a combination of 
dimness and low altitude</a>. The big embarrassment was the realization, 
while typing up these results for the website, that we had forgotten to 
do M&nbsp;55 and M&nbsp;16! :(
</p>

<p>As they trudged out in the dawn, Mike and Art felt pride in the
accomplishment of doing a complete marathon at the beloved Fuertes, a bit
extra pride in having surpassed the legendary Jagadheep :) &mdash; and, most
importantly, relief that, in completing a "proof-of-concept," they wouldn't
have to do this ever again!
