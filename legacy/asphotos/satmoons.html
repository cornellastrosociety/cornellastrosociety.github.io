<h2>The Moon, Saturn, and Its Moons</h2>

<p>On March 29, 2007 the Moon passed in front of Saturn as seen from some parts of the Earth. While the event wasn't visible from Ithaca, the two worlds did appear very close together in the sky, inspiring Mike Roman to assemble a mosaic. The <a href="photos/SaturnAndMoons_full.jpg">full version</a> is 8.3 MB in size (Internet Explorer and Firefox users should make sure the image doesn't get shrunk to the browser window), but you can see plenty just by looking at the reduced version below. Although Saturn is many times larger than the Moon, it looks far smaller because we see it from halfway across the solar system.</p>

<p>This close-up of the full mosaic shows Saturn with two of its moons. On the lower right is Titan, Saturn's largest moon; one ring-width to the upper left is Rhea, the second-largest. The dot on the far upper left is a star. Just how far away is Saturn? Titan is about 50% larger in diameter than the Moon; Rhea is half as large as ours. Both are dots in this image.</p>
