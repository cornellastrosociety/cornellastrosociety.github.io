<h3> Monday, June 16, 2003</h3>

<p>Despite a 93% illuminated moon, the night was a success. The moon
didn't rise above the trees until about 11:15. The dome was opened
at 9:30 while it was still fairly bright. Initially, all we could
see was Jupiter. The seeing was fair and one of Jupiter's moons
was on the verge of disappearing behind the planet. About 10      
people showed up and much discussion was had out on the deck. In fact,
there were so many questions, the single guide spent most of her time
outside talking instead of manning the telescope. There were quite a few
questioning minds. :-) Objects seen once the sky darkened were the Ring
Nebula and the Dumbell Nebula as well as an aurora.</p>

<hr />

<h3> Sunday, May 18, 2003</h3>

<p> The air wasn't very steady, and the seeing was moderate. After
showing Saturn and Jupiter, we went galaxy hunting.</p>

<br />
<ul>
<li> Leo I - tried to find this for more than half and hour but didn't see anything.</li>
<li> M98 - faint edge on galaxy</li>
<li> M99</li>
<li> M85 - there were two galaxies in the same field! Both quite bright and obvious</li>
<li> M100</li>
<li> NGC 4383 - a very faint and tiny galaxy at 12.1 magnitude</li>
<li> NGC 4379 and 4396 - both were sitting in opposite corners of the field, very
faint, at 11.7 and 12.6 magnitude respectively</li>
<li> M84 </li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3> Friday, May 9, 2003</h3>

<p> It started overcast at 9pm, but cleared up an hour later. The sky was
good for a moonlit night.</p>

Objects seen:
<ul>
<li> Jupiter</li>
<li> Saturn</li>
<li> The Moon at first quarter</li>
<li> Globular Cluster M13</li>
<li> Sombrero Galaxy M104</li>
<li> Galaxy M87</li>
<li> Ring Nebula</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h3> Wednesday, May 7, 2003 - Mercury Transit</h3>

<p> We hauled 3 Meade 8" scopes to Mount Pleasant just for this half hour
long event. It was overcast at about 5am, but by sunrise, the sky turned
completely clear in the east. The sun popped out of the horizon clouds at
about 6:00, and we went into action. We had 2 solar filters for 3 scopes,
so one scope was used for eyepiece projection. Mercury was but a tiny speck
near the edge of the sun. A sunspot could be seen in the same field of view.
Those present took turns at the scope, following the progress of Mercury
through that half hour. Eventually, in a matter of minutes after 6:30am,
Mercury went from being a spot at the sun's edge, to a tiny notch out of
the sun's disk, finally disappearing altogether. It was a morning well spent!</p>

<hr />

<h3> Monday, March 24, 2003</h3>

<p> We finally had a chance to gauge the effectiveness of the lens-cleaning.
The Moon was not up, and the sky was fabulous! The faint stars in Cancer and
the open cluster in Coma Berenices could be seen with the naked eye. Surprisingly,
we saw four visitors who happened to drop by. Here's a list of what we saw (and
those we tried but didn't see):</p>

<ul>
<li> Leo I - tried but couldn't see</li>
<li> M95</li>
<li> M96</li>
<li> M105</li>
<li> NGC 3384 - quite obvious</li>
<li> NGC 3389 - this was barely visible, at 11.9 magnitude - which is good news!</li>
<li> NGC 3369 - tried but couldn't see</li>
<li> M65 - the distinct north-south elongation was seen</li>
<li> M66 - some structure seen</li>
<li> NGC 3628 - barely visible, the direction of elongation was obvious</li>
<li> NGC 3593 (10.9 magnitude)</li>
<li> NGC 3596 (11.2 magnitude)</li>
<li> NGC 3655 (11.7 magnitude)</li>
<li> M104 (Sombrero Galaxy) - the dark band was quite clear</li>
<li> M53 (Globular Cluster in Coma Berenices) - amazing!</li>
</ul>

<p> And, of course... not forgetting Jupiter and Saturn.  Here was our
chance to try out the barlow lens that just came in. The seeing wasn't
fantastic, so it didn't look much better with the barlow on.</p>

<hr />

<h3> Sunday, March 16, 2003</h3>

<p>The second clear night in a row! The air was very steady and this permitted
an astonishing amount of detail to be seen on Saturn and Jupiter. A relatively
faint moon of Saturn was sighted... the cleaning of the lens might have some
noticeable effect after all.</p>

<p>The Eskimo nebula looked very good through the OIII filter, though background
stars were dimmed. We looked at M35 and tried to find the other open cluster
NGC 2158 nearby, but all that was seen was a loose association of stars. The
other objects we saw were M81 and M82. M82 was obvious and looked very thin
and extended, more so than before - something we would, again, like to attribute
to the lens cleaning. :)</p>

<hr />

<h3> Saturday, March 15, 2003</h3>

<p>This was the first clear session in more than a month. The daytime temperature
today went into the 50s ... spring is here!</p>

<p>Having just cleaned the refractor lens, we were anxious to look at faint
fuzzies through the main scope in spite of the bright gibbous moon. We also set
up a Meade LX10, one of the many which are kept in storage. </p>

<p>The first object seen through the main scope was the Orion Nebula, which seem
more contrasty. Having not looked through the scope for a long time, it is hard
to give an objective evaluation of any optical improvement, especially on a moonlit
night. We then tried for the Crab Nebula, with the nebula filter on. This object
was barely visible with averted vision. We later directed the scope at M3, M51,
and M104. It was amazing that M51 and its companion NGC 5195 were visible. The
Sombrero (M104), too, was seen without much difficulty, since it has a relatively
bright core. For a moonlit night, this was something!</p>

<p>We tried for more objects on the Meade LX10. However, not all of them could
be found. Here's a list of objects that the Meade LX10 actually saw:</p>

<ul>
<li> M42 (Orion Nebula)</li>
<li> Jupiter</li>
<li> Saturn</li>
<li> The Pleiades</li>
<li> M3 (Globular Cluster) - unresolved stars</li>
<li> M37 (Open cluster)</li>
<li> M57 (Ring Nebula)</li>
<li> M13 (Globular Cluster)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3> Friday, February 7, 2003</h3>

<p> It was clear from 8pm onwards, contrary to the forecast. The temperature
 was in the single digits. We looked at regular objects like Jupiter, Saturn
 and M42. Saturn looked stunning through the 32mm Televue. We could see the
 bands on Saturn, along with the Cassini division. These details were blurred
 in higher magnification eyepieces. </p>

<p> The only other noteworthy objects were M81 and M82 - two galaxies in Ursa
 Major with very different appearances. M81 is the larger of the two, and
 oriented face-on. M82, the edge-on galaxy, looked more interesting since it
 appeared very thin and extended. </p>

<hr />

<h3> Monday, November 18, 2002</h3>

<p> The Leonids meteor shower was supposed to peak at 11pm on the 18th and
 5am on the 19th. Unfortunately, it was cloudy for most of the night. We did
 catch some meteors at about 11pm-12pm through a break in the clouds in the
 east. Due to the moon and high clouds, only the brightest stars of Auriga,
 Orion, and Taurus could be seen. Meteor activity was far from storm level. </p>

<p> The clouds then got thicker and spelt the end to any effective meteor
 observing.  We stayed through the night in the hope that the clouds might
 at least clear partially, but it didn't, and we decided not to go to the
 plantations. So we left the observatory at 4:30am in the morning. </p>

<hr />

<h3> Friday November 8, 2002</h3>

<p> The first observing session after a long spell of cloudy skies... </p>

<ul>
<li>&gamma; Andromedae, double star, colorful orange-yellow and bluish-green
	components</li>
<li> E.T. cluster, NGC 457</li>
<li> Double cluster in Perseus, NGC 884 and NGC 869, open clusters. Very rich,
	but we couldn't get both to fit into the field of the 55mm wide-field
	eyepiece.</li>
<li> Saturn! The seeing was passable. The Cassini division was discernable,
	but little more than that was seen.</li>
<li> M42, Orion Nebula.</li>
<li> M38, open cluster in Auriga.</li>
<li> M1, Crab Nebula.</li>
<li> NGC 2392, Eskimo Nebula.  Tiny starlike haze. A blue tint was reported!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3> Monday, October 14, 2002 - Fall Break's extended observing session</h3>


<ul>
<li> NGC 7789, open cluster, nicknamed the "Magnificent Cluster". Very rich,
	 lots of faint stars.</li>
<li> &gamma; Andromedae, double star, beautiful yellow and bluish white
	components, just like Alberio.  It was rather turbulent, but we still
	managed to resolve the two.</li>
<li> M34, open cluster in Perseus. Sparse, counted about 50 stars in
	the FOV of the 30mm.</li>
<li> M31, M32, M110, Andromeda Galaxy and its companions. Very bright
	and extended. The core managed to fit in the FOV of the 30mm. M32 was
	tiny but bright. M110 was elusive and faint. It looked more extended
	than M32.</li>
<li> NGC 752, open cluster in Andromeda. Very sparse, more so compared
	to M34; but it has a slightly higher concentration of stars. Could not
	even fit into the FOV of the 55mm.</li>
<li> NGC 40, planetary nebula in Cepheus. We saw a fuzz around a bright
	spot... not sure if that was the central star. This object was quite tiny.</li>
<li> &sigma; Cassiopeiae, double star. Spent some time trying different
	eyepieces to see if the bright star was indeed the double. There was
	significant difficulty in achieving a nice focused image as the shorter
	focal length eyepieces shows a kind of "fog" around stars. Not very
	convinced that we saw this double.</li>
<li> M1, Crab Nebula in Taurus. Very faint and irregular.</li>
<li> M35, open cluster in Gemini. Very rich and wide open cluster.
	Impressive through the 55mm.</li>
<li> M37, open cluster in Auriga. Fits nicely into the FOV of the 55mm.
	Looks more compact than M35. Noticeable increase in concentration towards
	the center.</li>
<li> M36, open cluster in Auriga. About &gt; 100 stars. Sparse and not very big.</li>
<li> M38, open cluster in Auriga. Looks rather uniform and richer than
	M36, but not as rich as M37.</li>
<li> M42, M43, Orion Nebula. An object that never fails to impress.
	It definitely pays to spend a few minutes scanning around this region.
	The contrast between the nebulosity and dark area is fantastic.
	M43 was easily seen as a fainter haze surrounding a bright star.
	Very impressive.</li>
<li> M79, globular cluster in Lepus. A faint and tiny cluster. Stars are not resolved.</li>
<li> Saturn and Jupiter. The turbulence was disturbing the image of Saturn
	quite a bit. The main features were still visible, but not much could be
	made out on the planet's face. Only two moons of Jupiter were visible. </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3> Friday, September 28, 2002</h3>

<ul>
<li> M13, Globular Cluster.</li>
<li> Nova 4743 in the "Teaspoon" of Sagittarius, sighted
	through 16x70 binoculars.</li>
<li> NGC 7662, The "Blue Snowball" planetary nebula in Pegasus.
	Very bright and small in the 30mm eyepiece. Some hint of ring
	structure observed through the 20mm.</li>
<li> NGC 7331, Galaxy in Pegasus.</li>
<li> M57, Ring Nebula in Lyra.</li>
<li> NGC 7293, Helix Nebula in Aquarius. Very extended, barely
	perceptible through the Ultrablock filter.</li>
<li> M72, a very faint globular cluster in Capricornus. Stars are not resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Friday, September 7, 2002</h3>

<p> <strong> Northern Lights! </strong>
We were treated to a spectacular show of aurora tonight. The first
signs of the impending aurora storm happened between 8:00-9:00 pm. A
faint arc was visible across the northern horizon which cannot be
mistaken for light pollution. Not too long after, very intense green
rays started appearing in the direction of the Big Dipper, and
extended to Hercules and Draco.</p>

<p> A second wave started at about 9:25 pm. Green rays appeared near the
constellation of Perseus. This was followed by more activity in the area
below the pole star. Some hints of redness could be seen in some parts
of the sky. This wave of aurora activity faded considerably by 9:35 pm.
The mysterious glow in the northern horizon lingered on for a few hours.
Faint rays of northern lights appeared at midnight, but this time it was
much more subdued.</p>

<p> We had a great observing session after that impressive light show.
The sky was exceptionally clear.</p>
