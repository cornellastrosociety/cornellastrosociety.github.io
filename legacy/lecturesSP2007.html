<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2007</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Navigating the Night Sky, or "I <span class="superemi">Knew</span> I Shoulda' Taken That Left
Turn at Albireo!"</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">Bugs Bunny's navigational difficulties with respect to Albuquerque and
Pismo Beach are legendary. How much greater, then, might your problems
be in moving around the entire night sky? While you wouldn't be burdened
by "tunnel vision" like Bugs, the sheer scope of things might seem
daunting. Fortunately, a few easily-learnable constellations provide
guideposts for each season. We will learn how to recognize these star
patterns as seen from Ithaca, and how to use them to find less obvious
constellations elsewhere in the sky; we will also briefly discuss celestial
coordinate systems for use in binocular or telescope observing. In the
(alas, unlikely) event of clear skies that evening, we will immediately
follow the talk with a "lab practical" out on the observatory deck.</p>

<p class="title">Extraterrestrial Life</p>
<p class="presenter">Brian Crandall and Kim-Yen Nguyen</p>
<p class="abstract">The idea of extraterrestrial life has haunted the 
human imagination for thousands of years.  We have fantasized about 
finding innumerable alien races in the depths of the universe, stretching 
the realm of life as far as our imaginations permitted. But today's 
science fiction is tomorrow's scientific fact.  The history of science 
undeniably corroborates this statement.  Therefore, though many may scoff 
at the current absurdity of the prospect, there may be other sentient and 
intelligent beings in space beyond Earth.  How would such life arise?  How 
likely is an alien existence?  Though the idea of extraterrestrials seems 
strange, who is to say that these eternal figments of science fiction 
imagination do not exist? Join us at Fuertes Observatory as we explore 
the possibility of life beyond our globe in the vastness of space.</p>

<p class="date">March 2</p>
<p class="title">Eclipses</p>
<p class="presenter">Shianne Beer and Kim-Yen Nguyen</p>
<p class="abstract">In light of the impending lunar eclipse on March 3, 
CAS will be giving a lecture explaining the nature of these enchanting 
phenomena.  We will provide a general overview of the topic, describing 
what eclipses are, why, how, and when they occur, and how to view them 
so that you may more fully understand and appreciate the nature of the 
fantastic sight in store for you!</p>

<p class="date">March 9</p>
<p class="title">Astronomy in Popular Culture</p>
<p class="presenter">Bernadette Pang</p>
<p class="abstract">Star Wars. Star Trek. Men in Black. The Greek constellation
myths. Popular culture has long counted astronomy as one of
its biggest inspirations. Less obvious is the impact popular
culture has on astronomy. This lecture focuses on how
astronomical advances and popular culture, specifically
science fiction, have influenced each other and society at
large throughout the ages.</p>

<p class="date">March 30</p>
<p class="title">Ancient G(r)eeks</p>
<p class="presenter">Lisa Bacis and Elise Christensen</p>
<p class="abstract">This lecture will be a light-hearted exploration of 
some of the ancient Greek philosophies regarding the composition of the 
Earth and the universe beyond. From the genius ideas to the more obscure
theories, we will delve into the diverse astronomical insights of
Grecian antiquity.</p>

<p class="title">Giant Sundials in India</p>
<p class="presenter">Barry Perlus, Cornell Department of Art</p>
<p class="abstract">Between 1727 and 1734 Maharajah Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five
astronomical observatories in west central India. The observatories, or
"Jantar Mantars" as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple
buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for
astronomical measurement. In this presentation we will look at these
fascinating structures with the help of interactive panoramas and other
multimedia - and learn how the astronomers of Jai Singh's court measured
time on their great sundial to an accuracy of 2 seconds! For more
information about the Jantar Mantar see

<p class="title">Things That Go Bump in the Dark</p>
<p class="presenter">Krzysztof Findeisen</p>
<p class="abstract">Dark matter and dark energy are two phrases that have 
come up ever more often in science news. These terms come with an 
astonishing claim: 96% of our universe is made of something we can't see. 
In fact, most astronomers say, most of the universe isn't even 
matter, and most of the matter isn't anything like the stuff we find 
in stars, planets, plants, and people. Why should we think dark matter 
exists if we can't see it? For that matter, what <em>are</em> dark 
matter and dark energy? What's the difference? In this talk, we will 
explore discoveries on the cutting edge of cosmology and try to make 
sense of a universe well beyond our everyday experience.</p>

<p class="title">The Science of Star Wars</p>
<p class="presenter">Brandon Aldinger</p>
<p class="abstract">Learn about a galaxy long ago and far, far away at the close by Fuertes
Observatory in the near, near future.  Star Wars is undoubtedly one of the
most popular science fiction series ever produced.  But what is science
and what is fiction?  Could hyperspace, turbolasers, or Yoda actually
exist?  How does Apollo 10 stack up against an X-Wing fighter?  Explore
these and other icons of the saga, discovering the technological hurdles
keeping you from ruling the galaxy, in "The Science of Star Wars"!</p>
