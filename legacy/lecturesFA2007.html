<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2007</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:00 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Cosmology 101: Expanding Universe</p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">In this first CAS lecture of the semester, we invite you to explore the very nature of the cosmos. How did the universe come to be? How does the universe function? Is the universe for forever, or does it evolve with time? What is the mechanism that "drives" everything around us? The main focus of this lecture will be on the expansion of the universe.
<br><br>
We have known for some time now that the universe is expanding. But what does that mean? Discover the remarkable facts for yourself. Expand your intuition and visualize what it is like to live in a higher-dimension universe. Explore the evolution of the universe. Learn the forces that shape the cosmos. Understand how the mysterious dark matter and dark energy will ultimately deliver the universe to its ultimate fate.</p>

<p class="title">Mars: Not Just the Fourth Rock from the Sun</p>
<p class="presenter">Sarah Morrison</p>
<p class="abstract">Most of us know Mars to be the Red Planet, but so what? What is so interesting about it that has attracted geologists, physicists, and biologists alike? I will seek to address this as we delve into the history of Mars and what it may mean for the Earth as well as other terrestrial bodies. The Earth can only show us so much about the distant past (such as the period right after it formed), but Mars can act as our time capsule. Join us as we explore everything from possible life on Mars to Mars' traumatic past (which may also indicate something about Earth's).  </p>

<hr />

<p class="date">September 21</p>
<p class="title">Planetary Imaging With a Web Cam</p>
<p class="presenter">Rob West</p>
<p class="abstract">An introduction to how you can use an inexpensive web cam to obtain hi-resolution images of Solar System objects.  From data acquisition to image processing using freeware, The tools, steps, and methods used will be presented along with examples of the speakers' own work.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">September 28</p>
<p class="title">Alchemy, Astrology, and Celebrity: Tycho Brahe</p>
<p class="presenter">Ken Ferguson</p>
<p class="abstract">Learn about the man behind the Golden Nose for which he is so infamously remembered.  We will discuss what made him popular in the social realm and what made him popular in the scientific realm.  From his strange parties, to awkward pet animals, to astounding astrological findings, join us as we delve into the personal and scientific life that is Tycho Brahe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">October 5</p>
<p class="title">Johannes Kepler: Harmony, Faith, and Original Though</p>
<p class="presenter">Samuel Johnson Stoever</p>
<p class="abstract">There is hardly a person who doesn't know of the Genius that was Isaac Newton, but, as he confessed, he merely stood on the shoulders of giants. Kepler's scientific rigor revolutionized astronomy and mathematical physics, paving the way for the giants of the 17th and 18th centuries. This talk will focus on the fascinating life of the man who defied the church to reach higher understanding of god - the man who is credited as being one of the most revolutionary thinkers of the last millennium. </p>

<p class="date">October 12</p>
<p class="title">Comets: We All Love A Dirty Snowball</p>
<p class="presenter">Lisa Bacis and Brian Crandall</p>
<p class="abstract">The universe has a whole lot of stuff floating around in it, and some of it is right in our galactic backyard. Take the comet, for example: with the same consistency of snow and ice scraped off of a driveway, these periodic visitors were once thought to be harbingers of doom. Our modern minds, however, now know better, and we can enjoy the comets' dazzling displays in the night sky--although if one were to ever impact us, it could actually bring doom. This Friday, come visit the CAS lecture series at Fuertes for an entertaining and educating discussion about nature's dirty snowball.</p>

<p class="date">October 19</p>
<p class="title">Meteor Showers: The Rise and Fall of Shooting Stars
<br>Historic Happenings and How to Catch the Action Today</p>
<p class="presenter">Bari Greenfeld and Laura Hart</p>
<p class="abstract">Have you ever wished upon a falling star?
<br><br>
Come join us on a journey through the cosmic dust to explore the true nature of these spectacular celestial events! Discover an intriguing scientific basis for the existence of meteor showers, and unravel the multitude of mythological significance associated with these shooting stars across the ages. We will also demonstrate when, where, and how to locate meteor showers throughout the year - so you too can observe the delicate lightshows which, over time, have been imbued with the desires of thousands.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">October 26</p>
<p class="title">The Death of the Universe</p>
<p class="presenter">Jimmy Hartzel</p>
<p class="abstract">Some say the universe will end in a catastrophic
collapse, while others believe in a less dramatic gradual aging into an
empty chaos. Either way, the universe and any intelligent life in it seem
doomed to come to an end. This talk will discuss the possible fates of the
universe, and what it means for any (if there will be any) remaining
inhabitants.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 2</p>
<p class="title">The Big Bang</p>
<p class="presenter">Jenn Bailard</p>
<p class="abstract">Many people have opinions about the Big Bang, but what exactly is this theory, and what are its origins?  The lecture will address evidence in favor of the Big Bang as well as some of the unanswered questions.  In seeking to understand this theory, we will also discover how we can look back in time to see the early universe and why it is often said that we are made of stardust.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 9</p>
<p class="title">Astro-bio</p>
<p class="presenter">Bernadette Pang</p>
<p class="abstract">What is life?  How did simple chemistry bring about life on Earth?  How
would the planet from which it arose affect life on a molecular and
physiological level?  If there is life beyond the earth, how would it be
different from ours, and how would it be the same?  In what way can life
expand beyond its planet of origin, and how can we detect it? 
Astrobiology is the branch of science dedicated to finding answers to
these and other questions about Life, the Universe (if not quite
Everything).</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 16</p>
<p class="title">Cannonballs to Chaos: A Tour of Celestial Mechanics</p>
<p class="presenter">Anthony Milano</p>
<p class="abstract">From the Scientific Revolution to the present day, astronomy, physics, and mathematics have enjoyed a fruitful and exciting relationship.  I will present a non-technical overview of the fascinating subject of celestial mechanics, starting with Newton's brilliant work and ending with modern space mission design and computer simulations.</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 23</p>
<p class="title">No lecture, Thanksgiving Break</p>
<p class="presenter"></p>
<p class="abstract"></p>

<hr />

<p class="date">November 30</p>
<p class="title">Death of a Star: Supernovae Explained</p>
<p class="presenter">Avinash Balachandran</p>
<p class="abstract">Ever wonder what happens when a star dies out? Would it merely disappear quietly into the darkness or would it explode with the luminosity of an entire galaxy? Come learn more about a phenomenon that was first recorded by Chinese astronomers in AD 185 and continues to fascinate many. We will delve into the causes of supernovae and their different models of creation. We will also cover how discovery of these magnificent sights can be made by you! No talk about the death of stars would be complete without touching on the formation of black holes and neutron stars and we will explore this area briefly as well.</p>
