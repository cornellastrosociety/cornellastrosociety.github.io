Its original glass disks came as a gift from Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. Based on an assumption that its two lens elements are made of the same glasses that are in the 40-inch Yerkes refractor, a provisional study has been made of its optical properties. Charles Hastings of Yale was a long-term designer for Brashear. Hastings personally made a 9.4-inch objective for the Johns Hopkins University and published its complete specifications in 1882; the Church objective may have been a direct scale-up of the latter lens with minor adjustments. The talk will include a historical discussion of lens designing and evaluation methods, using two Hastings-designed objectives as examples.</div>

These observations define what we look for when searching for life on other planets. But what about ancient life on Earth? Would the earlier life that roamed the Earth during the past 500 million years (from sponges to the first trees to dinosaurs) have been detectable to aliens from faraway exoplanets? How can we tell? And should we be looking for space-dinosaurs?<br>Our second lecture of the semester, hosted by Dr. Rebecca Payne, will discuss research on the biosignatures of life on the ancient Earth and the potential use of similar biosignatures for our own interstellar life-seeking purposes.</div>

After the showing, Carl Sagan's wife and co-producer Ann Druyan featured in a live Q&A with the audience. In addition to her work on <em>Cosmos</em> in 1980, Ann Druyan was the writer and producer for the two newer seasons of <em>Cosmos</em> (A Spacetime Odyssey in 2014 and Possible Worlds in 2020). She has written and co-written dozens of books, television shows, and movies, including six books with Carl Sagan and the film adaptation of <em>Contact</em>. She was also a member of the Voyager Golden Record team, which selected pictures, sounds, and music from Earth to cast out into space; her heartbeat and brain waves will roam the stars for millions of years.</div>

These differing measurements of the Hubble expansion constant could indicate that a more complex model is needed to describe our Universe or could be due to a problem with one or more of the measurements themselves. We will discuss our current dark energy and dark matter dominated cosmological model as well as recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and other observatories that have contributed to this tension in our cosmological model. We will also briefly describe next generation observatories including the CCAT Observatory and Simons Observatory that will help address these questions in the future.</div>

However, for the first time in human history we have the capability not just to find, but also to characterize these far away worlds, termed as “Exoplanets". In this talk Dr. Goyal will show the astonishing variety of exoplanets that have been discovered and techniques used to find them. He will discuss how we study exoplanet atmospheres using the combination of remote sensing observations, 1D and 3D atmospheric models, retrieval techniques and thereby characterize them. Dr. Goyal will also briefly discuss how modeling the atmospheres of exoplanets from first principles, aid in-depth understanding of different processes, in the past as well as present Earth. Finally, he will show our approach to answer one of the most fundamental questions of humanity, Are we alone in this Universe?</div>

Despite decades of intense effort, we still have not found direct evidence for it, apart from its inferred gravitational presence. Dark matter constitutes about a quarter of the universe energy content and yet we have few clues about what it is made of. In this talk, Andre will describe the broad and active program currently underway to search for direct evidence of dark matter. This program encompasses diverse and complementary experimental techniques, theoretical models, and simulation paradigms. We are looking for dark matter everywhere: in the skies, in the laboratory, and on the planet – so far, with no luck. In this context, he will introduce his work in searching for dark matter using particle accelerators, which is part of a new front of theoretical and experimental efforts with potential to help us uncover this ever-growing mystery.</div>

                <div class="lecture_desc main_group">Are we alone? Or are there other worlds out there, like the Earth, that can support life? The field of exoplanet research has seen unprecedented progress over the last decade with over 3500 planets now been detected outside our Solar System. Further more, this number is expected to rise exponentially over the next few years with new and improved ground- and space-based telescopes set to take center-stage. Recent advances on this front suggest that small, Earth-sized, planets are abundant in our galaxy with many thought to lie in the host star's habitable zone where the conditions on the planet are optimal to have liquid water on the surface. This realization, coupled with the ongoing discovery of new organisms on Earth in environments previously thought to be inhospitable for life, suggests that extraterrestrial life could be far more commonplace than previously imagined. In this talk, Dr. Hegde will explore some of the methods that can be used in characterizing an Earth-like planet for potential habitability and life by providing a link between geomicrobiology and observational astronomy.</div>

At least 8 more examples of merging black holes and 1 example of merging neutron stars have been recorded subsequently. These discoveries highlight the emergence of a new astronomical discipline, gravitational wave astronomy. The experimental confirmation of the existence of black holes, a unique prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity, represents a home run for gravitational wave astronomy. We will review some of the history of the hunt for gravitational waves and speculate how the new discipline will help scientists explore new and otherwise inaccessible regimes of our Universe.</div>

This demanding mission requires technologies that don't exist yet but which we hope will be in place in 20 years' time, when we anticipate the probe will launch. If successful, this lightweight spacecraft will reach 20% light speed after a few minutes' thrust from a high-power laser. Then, some 21 years after launch, it will fly past Proxima B and transmits a few bits of data back to Earth: spectral information from an image? Radiation measurements? Confirmation of the presence or absence of radio communications near the planet?

                <div class="lecture_desc main_group">Astronomers have now found the first habitable rocky worlds around other stars – worlds that could have just the right temperatures to support life. So what happens next? To find out if these habitable worlds are inhabited, we need to know the global effects life can have on a planet, and crucially, which of those effects we could observe with our telescopes. We can gain some clues by looking at what life on Earth does today, but, so far, the planets we have found seem to have dramatically different environments compared to the modern day Earth. However, if we look millions, or even billions of years back through time, we start to find overlaps between conditions on these worlds and our own. The further back in time we look, the more alien our planet becomes. Strange environments, climates and weird forms of ancient life serve as perfect tools for figuring out many more of the unique “fingerprints” biology can leave behind on a planet for us to find. All of this takes us a step closer to finding extraterrestrial life – if it is there – on the un-Earth-like worlds around our nearest stars. In this talk Dr. O'Malley-James will discuss how we do this, what we might find, and what the future has in store for our quest to find other Earths.</div>

Previously established definitions of the habitable zone have adopted an Earth-centered approach, assuming that the main-sequence phase of stellar evolution, and the most common greenhouse gases on our planet - carbon dioxide and water vapor - are the established norms of habitability throughout the cosmos. Here, I argue that the Earth-centered approach can be causing us to overlook many potentially habitable planets on our target list. Not only can habitable worlds exist during other phases of stellar evolution, but other greenhouse gases, such as hydrogen, can significantly extend the width of the traditional habitable zone. I also discuss the potential habitability of Proxima Centauri b and the TRAPPIST-1 planets within the context of my new habitable zone definitions.</div>

Galileo first saw the planet and its rings through his small telescope in 1610, and described the planet as having "ears". As technology and our understanding of physics improved, Saturn's rings continued to perplex astronomers, and the system is still one of the most studied phenomena in the solar system. Launched in 1997, NASA's Cassini Spacecraft arrived at the Saturn system in 2004. Over the past decade, Cassini has returned a plethora of data on Saturn, its remarkable moons, and the spectacularly complex rings. On November 11th in the Fuertes Classroom, Professor Phil Nicholson will discuss many of the fascinating things that Cassini has discovered about the ring system, and how it has changed our understanding of how planetary ring systems form and evolve. </div>

Better technology is allowing astronomers to detect smaller and more extreme exoplanets than ever before, and the diversity of the planets discovered thus far is astonishing. Some of the most exciting findings have been the discovery of several rocky, "Earth-like" planets in the Habitable ("Goldilocks") Zones of their parent stars (i.e. ability for liquid water to exist on the surface). On November 4th in the Fuertes Observatory Classroom, Dr. Ramirez from Cornell's Carl Sagan Institute will discuss many of the intriguing planets found in the Habitable Zone, how they are being studied, and the prospect of possibly finding alien life on a planet light years away from the Earth.</div>

                <div class="lecture_desc main_group">Join us for our fourth annual Yuri's Night Event at 7:30pm at Fuertes, celebrating human spaceflight and space exploration. The event's talk will be given by Professor Mason Peck, former Chief Technologist at NASA. Where would you send a probe to search for life in the solar system? Probably somewhere with a warm water ocean. It turns out that Earth is not the only such place. There's Europa, Jupiter's icy moon that has more than double Earth's water. This talk will describe NASA's plans for a robotic Europa mission, which will conduct detailed reconnaissance during a number of close flybys in the 2020s to determine whether or not the conditions there are suitable for life as we understand it. It will use ice-penetrating radar and magnetometers to understand the depth and salinity of the ocean. And it will look at the heat signatures from plumes erupting from the surface, if they can be found. We'll also talk about some more speculative mission concepts, some of which are being developed at Cornell: among them, a soft robotic rover that could slither through the ice and jet around underwater like a squid, and a soda-bottle-size spacecraft carrying aluminum nanoparticles that would explosively react with ice and water on impact, creating a plume to be analyzed by a satellite overhead.</div>

He is the editor-in-chief of the planetary science journal, Icarus, and has served on the Committees on Planetary and Lunar Exploration and on Astronomy and Astrophysics of the National Research Council, time assignment committees for the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope, and scientific advisory committees for Arecibo and IPAC. Professor Nicholson is very interested in the history of astronomy, and how the people of ancient world used tools to understand the universe around them. On Friday, March 18th, he will discuss the history of Bronze Age astronomy in the Celtic World.</div>

                <div class="lecture_desc main_group">Galaxies come in a remarkable variety of shapes and sizes; some are red and some are blue. Exotic names describe some of them: the "Cigar"; the "Black-Eye"; the "Antennae". Additionally, while some galaxies inhabit the rich clusters of galaxies and have many thousands of neighbors, others exist in virtual isolation. During the course of their lifetimes, galaxies in such different environments are subjected to very a variety of interactions with their surroundings, sometimes triggering episodes of furious star formation or feeding their voracious central supermassive black holes. In this talk, we will discuss what the appearance of galaxies today can teach us about "extragalactic sociology": how their lives are affected by their environments.</div>

He has held visiting positions atthe Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, Institute for Advanced Study, Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of China, etc. On Friday, March 4th, he discussed "Extreme Planetary Systems" at Fuertes. Observations over the last decade have revealed exoplanetary systems that are completely different from our own Solar System. These extreme planetary systems are changing our view of planetary formation. Professor Lai focused on hot Jupiters, giant planets in close orbits around their host stars (period about 5 days). He also discussed planets around binary stars ('Tatooine').</div>
