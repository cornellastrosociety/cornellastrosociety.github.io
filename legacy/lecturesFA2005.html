<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2005</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required.</p>

<p class="title">Looking for Aliens</p>
<p class="presenter">Larry Klaes</p>
<p class="abstract">Does life exist beyond our planet Earth? Come see what 
aliens may look like, how we are searching for them, and what may happen when 
we do find each other!</p>

<p class="title">Kepler and the Music of the Spheres</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">In Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, music and 
astronomy were connected disciplines, part of the search for aspects of a single 
universal principle of "harmoniousness." The Renaissance astronomer Johannes 
Kepler was the last person to look seriously for such a "Grand Unified Theory;" 
in failing, he laid the foundations for Newtonian mechanics. This talk will look 
at some of those ancient connections and Kepler's search.</p>

<p class="title">Origins of the Universe</p>
<p class="presenter">David Eisler</p>
<p class="abstract">One of the most fundamental questions in astronomy is how the 
universe began. Did it just magically appear? Has it always existed? I will give a 
brief overview of the main theories about the origins of the universe and discuss 
their implications, from the scientific to the philosophical and even theological.</p>

<p class="date">November 11</p>
<p class="title">Near Earth Objects: Separating Fact from Fiction</p>
<p class="presenter">Krzysztof Findeisen</p>
<p class="abstract">It seems you can't pick up the newspaper or turn on the TV 
without running across a story about a "killer asteroid" endangering civilization. 
So far all these reports have been false alarms. But why do we keep seeing these 
stories? Is there really a threat? And, if so, what can we do about it?</p>

<hr />

<p class="date">December 2</p>
<p class="title">The Big Bang Was Only the Beginning: An Overview of the Largest Explosions in the Universe Today</p>
<p class="presenter">Richard "Doc" Kinne</p>
<p class="abstract">The Universe remains an energetic place. Come take a look at 
some of the latest information on such high energy objects as Gamma Ray Bursters 
(why they were a military secret years before the astronomers found out about 
them!), Cataclysmic Variables (stars that just keep on exploding!), and 
Supernova (the stepchildren of the Big Bang).<br /><br />
It'll make Atom Bombs look like firecrackers!</p>
