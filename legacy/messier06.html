<h2>Messier Marathon 2006</h2>

<script type="text/javascript">
writeMessierMenu();
</script>

<p>The second CAS Messier marathon of recent history was attempted
on March 27/28 at Fuertes. The instruments used were the
12-inch refractor and the 11 x 80 binoculars. Art and Mike participated;
while Shianne and Bernadette showed up around 9:15pm, stayed for about
90 minutes, and made good faith efforts, they were unable to locate any
objects that had not already been found.</p>

<p>Between cloudy nights and miscommunications on one clear night, we had
only weekdays left, which meant no chance to get the late-night objects
if we were to be functional at school/work the next day. To compensate, we
logged several non-Messier objects along the way. Also, since only 2 people
were taking part, we divided/optimized the work: because Mike was more
experienced at using the 'scope, he stayed on it and concentrated
on finding fainter objects. Meanwhile, Art did dome-moving/weight-winding
duties and logged as many objects by binoculars as possible, to buy Mike
more time for each harder object. Even so, we missed some early-evening
objects that were either too washed-out by light pollution or too low: M33,
M77, M79, M110. (We did, at least, bag M74, which had been missed in the
2004 attempt.)</p>

<p>Art had to give up around 1am, by which time we had logged some 50-odd
objects. Mike continued on solo until a bit after 3am; the tedium of
finding objects while having to mind the dome/weight, with no one else
there to share the beauty/wonder of it, finally proved too much. (It was
also becoming cloudy.) The final tally was 70 out of 110 Messier objects, 
plus 9 non-Messier objects.</p>

<p>The following is the log of objects seen, in order of time found.
Unless otherwise noted, all objects found by Art were via binoculars and
all objects found by Mike were via the telescope.</p>

<h3>Missing objects</h3>

<p> Most of the missed objects were the pre-dawn items in Aquarius and Capricorn,
a scattering of things primarily in Ophiuchus and Serpens Caput/Cauda, and items close
to the horizon in Scorpius and Sagittarius. (Because of tree-growth over the
last 20-30 years, the window for finding Scorpius/Sagittarius objects from Fuertes on
any given night is rather short.) If we had not been attempting the marathon on a
weekday, so that we could have been more gung-ho and others could have participated
and helped with dome/weight duties, it is likely that we would have been able to push
the final tally close to 90, even discounting the non-Messier objects.</p>

<p>There's always next year!</p>
