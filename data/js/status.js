They should reopen next week! Telescopes will be in use outside of the building, and the museum and slide wall will be open on the first floor of the building. As was done during the very first open houses at Fuertes in February of 1923, we will also make use of a glass slide projector with original glass slides to display antique photographs of astronomical objects.</span>
