<h2>The Great Orion Nebula</h2>

<p>You've probably seen Hubble photos of it. The Orion Nebula is one of, 
if not the, most spectacular objects in the sky, and no photograph does 
it justice. That didn't stop Mike Roman from stitching together 19 90-second 
exposures from his trusty Canon 300D camera to produce an image of most of 
the nebula. The size of the field of view is comparable to what you would 
see through the Fuertes eyepiece.</p>

<p>Like many other places throughout the Galaxy, the Orion Nebula is a 
stellar nursery. Gas clouds collapse to form stars or star clusters, and 
the largest, brightest, and hottest of these newborn stars produce huge 
amounts of ultraviolet radiation. This UV light hits surrounding gas and 
causes it to glow, producing a visible nebula. In the Orion Nebula, most 
of the radiation comes from a small group of stars in the center called 
the Trapezium. Unfortunately, the Trapezium is a bit overexposed in this 
image, but it's very easy to see through the telescope.</p>

<p>The red in this image is hydrogen, the most common element in the 
universe and the key ingredient of stars. The blue areas are not glowing 
gas at all, but rather ordinary starlight reflected from interstellar 
dust. The dark area in the upper left corner is more dust, this time 
blocking light from behind. You can see the dark dust if you visit 
Fuertes, but don't expect the colors -- the human eye is simply not 
capable of sensing color in something this faint.</p>
