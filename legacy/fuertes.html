<h2>About Fuertes Observatory</h2>

<p>CAS operates out of Fuertes Observatory (whose dome is the background image for this site), 
located on Cornell's north campus. Both the building and the telescope were built in the 1920s 
and are still in good condition. Some of our visitors have remarked that the "old-fashioned" 
look of the telescope is as much of an attraction as what they can see through it. The observatory 
also contains a small classroom, which we use for <a href="lectures.html">informal public 
talks</a> and club meetings.</p>

<p>Our main observing instrument is the 12-inch refracting telescope located in the observatory dome. 
However, we often pass out binoculars for observing from the observatory roof. The binoculars not only 
allow our visitors a more interactive experience than the main telescope, but also provide views of 
objects too large for the 12-inch to see as a whole. We also have a 14-inch reflecting telescope 
(sometimes called the "C-14") that we can mount on the roof on rare occasions, but usually the 
deck vibrates too easily for the telescope to produce a good image.</p>

<h3>Finding Fuertes</h3>
<p>Fuertes is located on a hill overlooking Helen Newman Hall and Appel Commons, easily 
reached from any part of the campus (click the image for a map of Cornell). For off-campus visitors, limited 
parking is available in the Appel lot across the street. We ask that you please turn off your headlights 
before you turn into a south-facing parking space; otherwise you may blind people at the observatory.</p></td>
