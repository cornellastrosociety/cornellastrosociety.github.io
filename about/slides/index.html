The galaxy is of scientific interest due to a supernova that was observed in 1986; it also served as the first light of the Large Binocular Telescope.

The planetary nebula NGC 2438 (the blurry object slightly larger than the stars in the photo) appears to lie within the cluster, but it is probably a more distant object.</p>

                            <p>The Snake Nebula (Barnard 72) is a dark nebula in the constellation Ophiuchus. While it does not glow on its own, it is a collection of gas and dust dense enough to block out nearly all the light from stars that are behind it. Often dark nebulae are responsible for star formation and other astronomically interesting phenomena. Taken July 4, 1921, through the 36-inch refractor at the Lick Observatory.</p>

                            <p>Comet Morehouse was a bright comet discovered by Daniel Walter Morehouse and was first observed in 1908. Comet Morehouse is unique in that it first formed its tail while it was still far from the Sun, about 2 AU away, and sprouted as many as six tails during its pass by the Sun. Comet Morehouse is believed to be a non-periodic comet; if it is a periodic comet, then its orbit is very large and will likely not return for million of years.</p>

The center of this image is black since the light form the Sun's disk is blocked - which allows astronomers to see fainter features. Taken August 13, 1908 from the Yerkes Observatory.</p>

At its closest approach, it passes closer to the Sun than Venus, whereas its further approach lies beyond Neptune. The image was taken the last time it was visible, on May 7th, 1986 from Fuertes Observatory. Comet Halley is scheduled to next be visible in 2061.</p>

                            <p>The Antenna Galaxies are two that are undergoing a starburst due to their collision. The original centers of the galaxies can be seen in the leftmost image as two yellow cores, surrounded by blue gas and dust. It is expected that in about 400 million years, the galaxies will finally fuse to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</p>

Its strong stellar wind precedes it, which compresses the interstellar medium and produces the curved shock front. It is likely that Zeta Oph was once a member of a binary star system whose companion exploded as a supernova, which caused Zeta Oph to be flung out of the system at high speed.</p>

Many of the stars in M80 are older and redder than our Sun, but some enigmatic stars appear to be bluer and younger. These blue stars are known as blue stragglers, and by analyzing pictures like this one, astronomers have been able identify one of the largest populations of blue stragglers to date. As blue stragglers are thought to be the result of nearby stars colliding, it is believed that stars are much more closely spaced, and thus collide more frequently, in M80 than in our stellar neighborhood.</p>
