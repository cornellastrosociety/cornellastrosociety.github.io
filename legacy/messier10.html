<h2>Messier Marathon 2010</h2>

<p>
The new moon for the 2010 marathon window happened a week before
the start of Cornell's spring break. Thus, none of the student members
were able to participate due to
papers and midterms. Art had already budgeted vacation days so
therefore attempted it solo on Monday, 16 Mar. Two of our freshman
members, Maia and Evelyn, did come by with a few friends for an
hour or so of study break; they did a fine job of giving their
friends sky tours and showing them various evening M-objects in
leisurely fashion, and also helped with winding the clock drive.
Evelyn and her friend Paula even stayed long enough to see all
the Virgo galaxies. Maia and Evelyn (and their friend Andrew,
who also "took a turn" on the clock drive) therefore get credit
for participating.

<p>
This was the first marathon attempt since the acquisition of Bob the
Dob and the 15x70 industrial binoculars. There had been hopes that
with multiple people manning things, we would be able to get a lot
more objects than just the Messiers, since over half the Messier
objects had been verified as visible through the binocs. The R.A.
calibration wheel on Irv had however become completely jammed recently,
already making Irv much less useful (e.g., dialing in M77 as had been
done in prior years failed). Also, with just one person present, the
danger that the dome might get stuck in one of the dead spots limited
using Irv only to targets from SE to SW. Most of the marathon was
thus done using Bob and the binocs. Between that and the knowledge
that pre-dawn M-objects were likely to be missed due to the attempt
being done at the beginning of the marathon window, as many non-Messiers
as possible were front-loaded in the early evening. A total of 125
objects, 28 non-Messiers and 97 Messiers, were found in just under
10 hours; 37 were found in Irv, 28 in Bob, and the Pleiades by eye,
with the other 66 in the binocs. (Note: the 1-day old Moon, only 1%
illuminated, was so stunningly beautiful that Art felt compelled to
watch it set completely in the binocs before beginning; he very deeply
regretted the lack of a camera.)

The 32mm wide-angle eyepiece was used with Irv while the 18mm was used
with Bob. The list of objects found was as follows (all times are

<p>
Of the failed Messiers, M74 is impossible in the sunset; M33 has been
seen in the binocs while in the east, but in the west over the city
the light pollution is apparently too much. M77 could not be dialed in
on Irv and would have taken too long on Bob. Repeated attempts
were made to get M108 and M97 in Bob, consuming well over an hour during
the night. M30 can never be gotten from Ithaca during the
marathon window. Ms, 72, 73, and likely M2 were also
going to be lost in the dawn due to trying the marathon at the start of
the window. Of the remaining missed pre-dawn targets, M15 had not yet
risen above the observatory dome to get in the binocs; while it was high
enough to get in Irv, that would have risked hitting a dome dead spot.
M54 is binocs-visible only at culmination, and was too low for Bob; it
was in the tree gap to the SE, except that Art no longer trusted himself
at the very top of the ladder while alone. M75 and M55 had not yet cleared
the trees and dawn had already begun, so Art stopped at 6am.
