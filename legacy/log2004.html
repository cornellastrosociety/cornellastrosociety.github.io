<h3>Friday, July 29, 2005</h3>

<p>Mostly clear skies early on gave rise to mostly cloudy skies (altocumulus).
Large crowd early on, treated to excellent viewing of Jupiter. Other objects:
M13, M57, Albireo, Dumbbell Nebula, M14 (barely visible) and M15. A few
very nice meteors as well, one of which passed the finder scope's field of
view.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 22, 2005</h3>

<p>Large crowd visited for Friday night open house. Conditions were mostly
clear with occasional low clouds. Objects included the usual favorites: Jupiter,
M57, M13, and for a family interested in colors, Albireo and Mu Cephei.
Also, a glimpse at a nearly full waning moon.<br />
Note: we must keep the logbook closed from now on to prevent, ahem,
"entries" by guests.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, July 13, 2005</h3>

<p>Opened at 9:30pm for a group of 22 kids. Showed Jupiter (2 moons
visible) and the Moon. Went on to Cassiopeia clusters after the folks
left: NGCs 7789 (magnificent cluster), 7790, 7788, 457 (ET Cluster), 663,
and M103. Mike stopped by around midnight.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 12, 2005</h3>

<p>Open for CAU stargazing. Very hazy but observed Venus, lunar craters,
and Jupiter. Great pass of the ISS at 10:42pm--very bright (mag. -0.3), and
crossed the entire sky.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 24, 2005</h3>

<p>Clear Friday night, save a few cirrus low on the horizon. A large, diverse
multi-national crowd visited for pre-moonrise observations of: Venus,
Saturn, and Mercury all in one binocular field of view, Jupiter, M12, M27,
M57, M80, and M4*.<br />
(* First time observed at Fuertes by the three officers--Jagadheep, Mike,
Guanhan--, the notoriously elusive cluster was located by Mike.)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 27, 2005</h3>

<p>Mostly clear Friday night. Seeing good near zenith; bad at about 45 degrees
elevation. Objects: Saturn (Titan, Rhea could be seen), Jupiter, M57, M51,
&epsilon; Lyrae.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 6, 2005</h3>

<p>Clear Friday night. Atmosphere transparency not good; seeing not good.
A group of elementary students and teachers dropped by. Objects: Saturn
(could not see Cassini Division due to seeing), Jupiter (could see Big Red
Spot), M81, M82, M5, M104.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 16, 2005</h3>

<p>Clear Friday [sic] night. First
quarter moon phase. Objects: Saturn, Jupiter, Moon, M3.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday-Sunday, April 9-10, 2005</h3>

<p>Clear Saturday night. Pon and Mike attempted a mini Messier marathon,
but didn't log in times. M-objects found: 42, 43, 36, 37, 38, 35, 100, 99, 88, 91, 90,
89, 58, 59, 60, 87, 44, 45. M-objects looked for but not found: 78, 1, 98, 86.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 8, 2005</h3>

<p>Clear Friday night. Pon gave a lecture on Cosmology at 8:00pm. Objects:
Orion Nebula, Jupiter, Saturn. Var. star estimates of &alpha; Orionis and
U Monocerotis.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 25, 2005</h3>

<p>Partly cloudy Friday night. (Spring break.) There were quite a few visitors.
Objects looked at: Saturn, Moon, Jupiter, M37.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 4, 2005</h3>

<p>Mostly clear Friday night. Mike opened alone and was accidentally locked
out of the dome when, having left his keys on the eyepiece case, the wind
blew the door shut as he was outside shoveling snow. A kind visitor
provided him a ride to Krzysztof's dorm to borrow his key. Let this be a lesson
to those observing alone.</p>
<p>Targets: Saturn, Jupiter, Orion Nebula.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 4, 2005</h3>

<p>First observing night of the year, Partly cloudy, then hazy. Opened
observatory at 8:15 and tested repairs to telescope RA controls. Telescope worked
fine but some eyepieces had dewed over. Pointed telescope at Saturn. At 9:00
haze moved in. Saturn could be seen through telescope but not naked eye, so
changing targets impossible. Total of 3 visitors. Closed at 10:00.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, December 17, 2004</h3>

<p>Last day of exams. Partly cloudy, then mostly clear. Guanhan opened at
8pm and showed objects like Saturn, the Orion Nebula, M38, and M36. Most
visitors were townies. Jagadheep came later, when Guanhan was looking for
Comet Macholz, which didn't show signs of a tail. Other objects seen: M79, M1,
M78 (finally!). Total of 10-20 visitors. Closed at midnight.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, December 3, 2004</h3>

<p>First, had CAS meeting regarding Spring '05 lectures (Doc, Debbie
attended meeting, then left). Afterwards opened for public (partly cloudly
skies). Objects looked at: Double Cluster, Gamma Andromedae, M38. Had
lively argument on what M38 looks like. Clouded up at 10pm and closed up
at 10:30.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 26, 2004</h3>

<p>Partly cloudy Friday night (~cloudy at 8pm, ~clear at 8:30). Krzysztof
opened observatory at 8:30; Jagadheep and Mike showed up at 10:15. Objects
observed: Moon (full; observed with variable polarization filter), NGC 7789,
NGC 663. 10-15 visitors tonight (day after Thanskgiving).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 12, 2004</h3>

<p>Clear Friday night (slightly cloudy in south). Objects looked at: Double
Cluster, Pleiades, M77 (NGC 1068), M38, Saturn (turbulent, but Cassini
Division, atmospheric band could be seen).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 5, 2004</h3>

<p>Doc lectured on variable stars to about 24 people. Quasi-clear skies; so
public observation night. Targets: M15, M37. Clouded up at 10:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, October 27, 2004</h3>

<p>Public opening for total lunar eclipse. Mostly clear sky, with few passing
altocumulus clouds. Totality lasted from 10:23pm to 11:45pm. Large crowd despite
competition with Boston's World Series victory.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 22, 2004</h3>

<p>Public observation night. Mostly clear, but moist. Moon, first quarter.
Objects: Moon, E.T. Cluster, M57 (Ring). Krzysztof lectured on extra-solar
planets to a full crowd.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, October 9, 2004</h3>

<p>Practice night. Found M13, then aborted at 10:00 due to cloudy weather. A
group of four dropped by and we answered some general questions.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 8, 2004</h3>

<p>Public observation night. Scattered cirrus clouds. Small crowd due to fall
break. Objects: M15, Albireo, Perseus Double Cluster. Finished session before
moonrise. Closed a half hour early.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 1, 2004</h3>

<p>Public observation night. Scattered cirrus clouds. A bit chilly; a large
crowd tonight. Objects: M15, M57 (Ring Nebula), E.T. Cluster, bright gibbous
(waning) moon (Pon looks at moon with naked eye and complains it is
bright!), M2. Mike closes on his own--training almost complete.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 24, 2004</h3>

<p>Public observation night. Scattered clouds. Bright gibbous moon. Trained
scope on &beta; Cygni, the moon, and Uranus. Set the binoculars on the
deck and shown them on the moon and the Pleiades.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 11, 2004</h3>

<p>Held an instruction session for the Astro Department TAs. Went over
dome opening and closing procedures and also practiced finding various
bright objects: Vega, &beta; Lyrae, M13, M27, M57.</p>
<p>The clock drive has ceased working completely and Jagadheep and the
TAs are working at its repair.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 10, 2004</h3>

<p>Public viewing night. Perhaps 80 people in attendance through the night.
Continued to have problems with the clock drive. Jagadheep has made some
progress for getting it fixed.</p>
<p>Concentrated the scope on M31, M32, M17, M15 (globular cluster in
Pegasus, containing a planetary nebula), and &gamma; Andromedae.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 4, 2004</h3>

<p>Small class to teach the new members the operation of the scope. Trained
scope on Vega, Altair, &gamma; Lyrae and the area of M51. Had a few visitors
walk in and look about.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 3, 2004</h3>

<p> Regular public night. Was largely cloudly but we started out with
&beta; Cygni, moved on to M15, and ended up with the Ranger 9 crash site
on the Moon. (Debris was not obviously visible...)</p>
