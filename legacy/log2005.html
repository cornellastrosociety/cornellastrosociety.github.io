<h3>Wednesday, August 16, 2006</h3>

<p>Art opened for a few family members in town on vacation. He showed the usual 
objects: Jupiter, Albireo (a colorful double star), M13 (Hercules Cluster; in 
both binoculars and the telescope), the Coathanger (a.k.a. Al Sufi's Cluster 
or Brocchi's Cluster), and a very bright (magnitude -6) Iridium flare. One 
person stayed longer, and Art showed him the spiral galaxy NGC 7331 and (with 
assistance from Jaghadeep and Mike) Uranus. Art left the two looking for 
a faint galaxies. After failing to find NGC 6503 and NGC 6482, Mike decided 
to point to the much more familiar M27 (Dumbbell Nebula) and captured a very 
promising image with his camera.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 15, 2006</h3>

<p>A last quarter moon and mostly clear skies allowed for some challenging star 
hops as we attempted to view uncommon and lesser known NGC objects. These included 
the planetary nebulae NGC 6210, NGC 7008, NGC 7026, NGC 7027, and NGC 6741 (Phantom 
Streak Nebula), the open star clusters NGC 7142 and NGC 7086, the spiral galaxy 
NGC 7606, and Uranus.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 12, 2006</h3>

<p>Mike started with some afternoon solar observing. Two prominent sunspots were 
viewed and photographed along with three solar prominences. Later, in the evening, 
Mike and Art celebrated the peak of the Perseid meteor shower by enjoying a 
screening of "Clash of the Titans" projected upon the outer wall of the Johnson 
art museum. The outdoor showing allowed a lucky few to actually see Perseids 
while viewing the hero's tale. Following the film, Mike returned to Fuertes to 
find it empty despite plans for a group observing session. About 8 visitors 
arrived and requested nebulae, which were happily provided. Shianne stopped in 
for a moment (apparently taking a break from her moving), asked if anyone else 
would be coming, discovered it would be only her and Mike, and promptly decided 
to go back to moving. Mike carried on entertaining the visitors, two of whom 
stayed to 3:00 AM discussing classical music and viewing over 30 Perseids while 
stretched out on comforters on the deck. The company they provided was very 
pleasant and much appreciated. Objects viewed included M57 (Ring Nebula), 
M26 (an open star cluster), NGC 6905 (Blue Flash Nebula), and a waning 
gibbous Moon.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 11, 2006</h3>

<p>A steady stream of visitors showed up (about 50 in all), but the crowds were 
not overwhelming like in the previous week. It was an excellent night for seeing 
except for a nearly full moon. Art avoided our usual Jupiter holdup by moving 
immediately to the Rocking Horse Cluster (NGC 6910). We also saw Albireo, 
M3 (a globular star cluster), NGC 457 (Owl/ET/Dragonfly Cluster), and 
NGC 7331 (a galaxy unfortunately washed out by the Moon). The first cold night of 
the season chased Shianne, Mike, and Jagadheep downstairs. Reportedly there were 
some juggling lessons involved.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, August 9, 2006</h3>

<p>Art returned to catch a few things missed in yesterday's moonlight.
Got M27 (Dumbbell Nebula), M71, NGC 7789 (a rich star cluster), and 
NGC 6934 (a globular star cluster). He looked a fairly long time for
the globular cluster NGC 7006 but failed to find it; the spiral galaxy NGC 6946 in 
Cepheus was a very iffy possible catch, but the Moon was up by then. 
Both this night and the previous night had satellites zip thru the finder 
scope's viewfield, a somewhat "eep!" experience. Closed at 10:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 8, 2006</h3>

<p>Art practiced solo until midnight. Cloudless, cool, dry evening; would
have been perfect had not a full moon been washing out most things. Started
with a fast peek at Jupiter (solely to check the amount of atmospheric
turbulence!) then a bunch of open star clusters: NGC 6910 (Rocking Horse),
NGC 457 (Owl/E.T./Dragonfly), M52, M103, Do10, NGC 663, and NGC 659 (very faint
and tiny). Also got the Blinking Planetary Nebula (NGC 6826), the spiral galaxy 
NGC 7331, and a quickie practice find of M57 (Ring Nebula). In the binocs 
M31 (Andromeda Galaxy) was as usual, but M24 (Small Saggitarius Star Cloud) 
was nearly washed out.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 5, 2006</h3>

<p>Brandon brought his Celestron 8-inch Goto telescope, through which we
looked at various objects (without keeping a log). Fixed the main telescope's 
Telrad problem with double-sided tape, then looked at Jupiter (for four
visitors), M5 (a globular star cluster), NGC 6891 (star-like planetary nebula), 
NGC 7217, NGC 7457 (a galaxy), NGC 7006 (globular cluster), NGC 559, 
NGC 663 (two open star clusters), NGC 6905 (Blue Flash Nebula), and NGC 6934. 
NGC 6905 and 6934 will make good Friday night targets.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 4, 2006</h3>

<p>Waxing gibbous moon and a few stray clouds. The first six visitors asked to
see the Moon and Jupiter since there was nothing else visible; but before we
could get them finished and switch objects, a continuous stream of people
began coming up the stairs and we couldn't move to something else until after
10:30--lost count of number of visitors past 90. (A few visitors complained
that they'd already seen Jupiter.) Eventual tally of objects: Jupiter, Moon,
M11, NGC 7331 (a spiral galaxy), M15 (a globular star cluster), M52, 
M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), M32 (satellite to M31), NGC xyz [sic], and NGC 891 (an 
edge-on spiral galaxy, seen only by Mike).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 1, 2006</h3>

<p>Hot clear start to the month with a high temp. of 94 F and a heat index of
105. Brian Kent opened for another CAU session and Mike joined him to host
another group of summer students. Viewed the Moon, Jupiter, M3 (a globular 
star cluster), M13 (Hercules Cluster), M11 (Wild Duck Cluster), NGC 7331, 
and attempted some photography of M11.</p>
<p>It also came to our attention that the Fuertes observatory can use an ice
cream parlor, swimming pool, and water slide extending from the top of the
ladder, so visitors can look at Jupiter and simply slide down for a refreshing
exit.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 31, 2006</h3>

<p>Clear but sticky summer night. Art arrived for a little bit of practice
and Mike came by after a movie. Sights included a nearly first-quarter waxing
crescent Moon, Jupiter, M57 (Ring Nebula), M39 (an open star cluster), 
M15 (a globular star cluster), and some very impressive meteors (Delta 
Aquarids?). Mike attempted some astrophotography with the aid of a new 
T-mount for his digital camera.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 28, 2006</h3>

<p>Mostly clear public night. Shianne opened, with Mike coming by after ushering
for Cornell Cinema. Then, to everyone's amazement, the long-lost Pon made an
appearance, quelling rumors of his waning interest in clear Friday nights. We 
saw M13, M3, Blinking Eye [sic], Jupiter, the Moon, and M57.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 24, 2006</h3>

<p>Art opened for a small but cosmopolitan group of 4 (Toronto; Edinburgh).
We only looked at Jupiter, M4 (a globular star cluster), M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy), 
and the Coathanger (through binoculars) before the kids in the party got 
too sleepy. However, about 10pm we did see a cluster of satellites zipping by 
in multiple directions, including a Truly Splendid&trade; Iridium flare of 
magnitude -8(!). (We were 1.6 km from the center, according to 
heavens-above.com...)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mike and Jagadheep escaped the light-polluted haze of Ithaca
and fled to the dark sky sanctuary that is Southern Cayuga Central School's
observatory. There, Alan Ominsky and his Meade LX90 and LX200 provided a
wonderful night of observations, many of which could never be made from the
Fuertes. Mike and Jagadheep enjoyed M107, M21, NGC 6546, NGC 6451, NGC 6441,
NGC 6400, NGC 6818, M57, M75, M55, NGC 7009, NGC 7293, NGC 6755, M106,
M63, NGC 5033, NGC 5005, NGC 6210, M13, M92, M30, M7, M16, M8, M51, Jupiter,
M11(!!!), M27, NGC 40, the Blinking Planetary Nebula, M97, the Veil Nebula, and M110,
while Shianne studied physics.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 21, 2006</h3>

<p>A fairly ordinary Friday night viewing session (highlighted by the
presence of CAS alum Tanja Bode, in for a visit). We had clouds. We
had haze. We had requests for Jupiter. There were several very
enthusiastic guests, especially right at the end. We only looked at
Jupiter, Albireo (colorful double star), M3 (a globular star cluster), 
and the Blinking Planetary Nebula.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, July 19, 2006</h3>

<p>Mike and Art arrived ca. 10:30pm after a movie, with Jagadheep
coming by soon after. Art practiced sundry Sagittarius objects for
the entertainment of the others (in Jagadheep's words, "You can go for anything you
like so long as you do not bore us"): globular star clusters M69, M70,
M54 (good tight one, although could not resolve individual stars),
M28, M22, and NGC 6638, then the open star cluster M25. 
We also caught M13 (Hercules Cluster), M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), 
the Perseus Double Cluster, and the Kemple's Cascade and Coathanger
asterisms in binoculars. At 1am Art left Mike Neptune-hunting; after the fact, it
is not clear whether he and Jagadheep actually found it.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 18, 2006</h3>

<p>Brian Kent held another (short) observing session for about 40
people, doing only Jupiter. Mike then showed up ca. 11pm to resume
his survey of southern galactic clusters, this time including "the
impressive" M11 (Wild Duck Cluster), M12, M10, M14, M5, M9, and "the amazingly pathetic"
M107. As he was closing ca. 2am, he was massively traumatized by a
spider, to the extent of (as he reported the next night) being
unable to sleep at all...</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 17, 2006</h3>

<p>A warm, moonless, slightly hazy but mostly clear night provided
observing for Mike, special Cornell Adult University guests and 
summer co-worker Brian. Objects enjoyed included M13 (Hercules Cluster), 
&epsilon; Lyrae (a quadruple star system), Jupiter, M57, M22,
M28, M25 (three globular star clusters), M8 (Lagoon Nebula), 
M21 (an open star cluster), M20 (Trifid Nebula), and "the
incomparable" M11.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, July 15, 2006</h3>

<p>After watching <em>V for Vendetta</em>, Shianne, Jagadheep, and
Mike arrived at midnight and "rocked out until after 3." In between
singing and bouts of boogie-ing they found M16, M17, M18 (three open 
star clusters), M10, M14, and M2 (three globular star clusters).</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 14, 2006</h3>

<p>The skies were overcast with cirrus at 9pm, but super-optimist
Shianne predicted clearing skies; displaying hitherto-unknown powers
of weather control, she did indeed clear the sky for several hours,
allowing a large crowd to see Jupiter. High clouds precluded
observations of most deep-sky objects, but M57 (Ring Nebula) and the 
Blinking Planetary Nebula were found before it clouded up at 11:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, July 13, 2006</h3>

<p>Art and Brian Kent (Astro grad doing CAU sessions) opened, this
time letting the Taiwanese group have first dibs at seeing things.
Due to the crowding on Tuesday, Mike and Art put the C-14 out on
the deck and dedicated it to Jupiter-watching so as to leave the
main scope available for other things, including M5 (a globular 
star cluster), Albireo (colorful double star), the Ring Nebula, 
M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy), and the Blinking Planetary Nebula. After 
bopping off for a movie, Mike returned to observe solo until 3am. 
He showed a late group of visitors M13 (Hercules Cluster) and M57, 
then went to explore the Cygnus starfields. He visited M29, M39, IC 5146, 
and many other open star clusters. He also spent "too much time" looking for
NGC 188, located at +85&deg; [this is extremely close to the north pole, 
a region of the sky where our telescope is very difficult to point].</p>


<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 11, 2006</h3>

<p>Due to a miscommunication, there were <em>two</em> groups coming in for
a weekday open house, for a total of ca. 75 people, of all ages. As it was,
the clouds shut us down by 9:45pm, so that we couldn't even get all of the
Cornell Adult University (CAU) group through a Jupiter viewing, let alone
any of the second group, some middle-schoolers from Taiwan. (CAU had been
scheduled earlier, so they got first dibs on the scope.)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, July 8, 2006</h3>

<p>Hazy evening was extremely quiet (with exception of Classic Rock music
compromise) until large group of about 25 students from the h.s. program
arrived following the clouds. Closed by 11 after giving the "cloudy night"
tour. In our spare time we admired bands of cirrocumulus clouds drifting
across the waxing gibbous moon.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 7, 2006</h3>

<p>Some 60-70 customers early in evening, including multiple families; ca. 12
more arrived at closing. Seeing was bad--another so-called "clear" night, only
about 20 stars visible. (Supposedly, particulate haze from Western Canadian
forest fires got into the jet stream and is being deposited here...) Saw Moon,
Jupiter, Albireo, M57, &epsilon; Lyrae, M5. (Hearing also declined precipitously,
after a perfectly reasonable start by Samite of Uganda... :-)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 30, 2006</h3>

<p>Good crowd--60 in early evening, about 10 late. Seeing fair-to-hazy, some clouds.
Moon in reg./wide-angle eyepieces, Jupiter (twice), &epsilon; Lyrae, M13 in both
scope/binocs, M57, M51/NGC 5195, Coathanger cluster in binocs. Ca. 12:45, Mike
started a run for M39 &amp; the Cocoon Nebula, only to face an emergency
shutdown due to rain. (Of course it immediately cleared up once we'd closed...)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 24, 2006</h3>

<p>Customers: six students from the h.s. summer program plus an enthusiastic
Vietnamese gentleman. Jupiter, M13, &epsilon; Lyrae, M4, M80, M51/NGC 5195.
Attempts to view other Sagittarius/Scorpius objects foiled by clouds, which shut
us down at 12:20. Very hazy; seeing bad all evening.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 17, 2006</h3>

<p>Mercury, Saturn, M94, NGCs 4490, 6826, 6210. A few visitors stopped by.
Shianne, Mike, and Jagadheep held wide-ranging discussions on arthropods, et
al., especially spiders.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 16, 2006</h3>

<p>Huge crowd tonight, ~60. (To watch 4 planets?) Set up C-14. Objects looked
[at]: Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, usual summer suspects (M13, M57, Albireo),
M51; M4 through C-14.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, June 14, 2006</h3>

<p>After a thoroughly humiliating failure to find Mercury in the scope the
previous night and annoyed at the waste of an evening, Art returned armed
with coordinates for the thing and had it dialed in before sunset. Fulfilled
his oath to see all four planets in the scope in one evening and closed at 9:45.
In the 12mm eyepiece Mercury was an obvious but featureless
half-moon. Mars showed as much disk as Jupiter shows these days in the 10x
binocs--might have seen a hint of polar cap, but more likely it was chromatic
aberration. Saturn was way too blurred by atmosphere to see the Cassini
division in the rings; could barely make out hints of cloud bands.
Seeing was excellent for Jupiter in the 32mm, however: lots of structure visible
in the equatorial bands and to their sides.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 10, 2006</h3>

<p><span class="superem">Finally</span> a clear day, if <em>cold</em> and windy.
Art arrived at 6pm to do solar observing (and to find a parking spot, given
the glut of alumni cars!). One good sunspot, two prominences; four people
stopped by and saw the sun. The evening went very well: a good 60-70
people during the evening (including a number of alums who'd never been
to Fuertes while students and were dismayed by what they'd missed, plus one
CAS member from the late '70s); it was very crowded at times. Full moon
washed out most stuff. Mostly Jupiter for the crowds; some Saturn, but it's
now too low in the west for extended viewing. Did get to M13, M44 in binocs,
Albireo, M57, and the double-double star &epsilon; Lyrae. Shianne put the moon
filter on the wide-angle 40mm and we looked a bit at the Moon. Jagadheep
convinced Art to try a star-hop from Albireo to M27; he got it just as clouds
closed us down at 12:45.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 9, 2006</h3>

<p>Twelve people came by--pretty good considering it was raining!!
It was Alumni Reunion Weekend; public viewing had been listed on the
schedule only for Friday, 9-10:30pm, which was absurd--we're only just
hitting our stride by then! Besides getting the Alumni Office to correct the
entry, Art had volunteered to open on both Thursday and Saturday--alas,
it was completely overcast both Thursday and tonight. He only showed up
to take the logbook home for data entry of older entries, but Mike called to
remind him that a school group had been scheduled to come and they had
not canceled. They didn't show, but several alumni families looking for
their kids who were in it did, followed by an enthusiastic couple with
whom he and Shianne (who arrived about 10) had a fun and wide-ranging talk
(esp. about Steve Squyres' book-signing at the Campus Store the next
morning).</p>
<p>[N.B.: The Telrad is fixed for now, via aggressive use of medical tape
by Jagadheep.]</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, June 6, 2006</h3>

<p>One guest came by during Shianne's continued cleanup. "I dazzled him
with Saturn, the Moon, and Jupiter before he had to go home. Enthusiastic
people are so much fun.:-)"</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 5, 2006</h3>

<p>Shianne had begun a multi-day cleanup effort, because "I had a sneaking
suspicion that no one else was going to do it anytime soon..." Aside from
being repeatedly startled by the compensating binnacle, she practiced
on open clusters in Cygnus: NGC 6996, Cr428, Do43, Do10, NGC 6913 (M29),
and Be86. ("It seemed like there were so many <em>more</em>!")</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 30, 2006</h3>

<p>The high temperatures within the dome the past two days have led to a
propensity for stream-of-consciousness log entries--we should consider
purchasing a fan. Shianne combined some astronomical/meteorological
observing, with Jupiter and Spica hanging over an intense lightning storm
in the low southern skies while Castor, Pollux, Mars, Saturn, and the
crescent moon formed a group in the west. Shianne's "drive-in omni-theater"
experience was ruined only by several spiders and one Mike.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 29, 2006</h3>

<p>Shianne did some solo observing/practice, looking at the Moon, Jupiter,
M57 (Ring Nebula), and M3 (a globular cluster). Jagadheep came by and they 
played with different eyepieces for Jupiter. With summer having been turned 
on for Graduation Weekend, the heat made for problems; in particular, the 
previous night's fix of the Telrad failed and "I found it barely hanging on 
after I flipped the scope." A permanent solution remains to be found.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, May 28, 2006</h3>

<p>In the afternoon Jagadheep trained Shianne and Art on solar observing,
using both the mylar and hydrogen-&alpha; filters. Although the Sun is near 
the minimum of its 11-year activity cycle, we saw not only several sunspots 
but also no less than five major prominences with exquisite fine structure. 
(In Shianne's words: "Wow! Solar prominences are even more spectacular 
than I was imagining, if that's possible.")</p>
<p>In the evening, there was a quiet but steady stream of visitors (final
tally, around 35-40) until 1:00am(!), including two ladies in their 70s/80s 
who were troopers enough to climb the ladder (at least a little ways, with 
assistance) to look at Jupiter and M13 (Hercules Cluster). The moon was one 
day past new, so Art began with it: given two little stars near the tip of 
the terminator, the Moon's motion was visibly obvious in the wide-angle 40mm,
and various features could be seen in reflected earthlight. Besides the other
usual suspects (i.e., Saturn and Jupiter), we saw and/or showed visitors M65
(a Leo galaxy), M13, M57 (Ring Nebula), NGC 6543 (Cat's Eye Nebula),
M19, and M11 in the scope, plus M44 (Beehive Cluster) and M13 in binoculars. 
(Another Telrad misalignment caused us to stop for a while--turned out the 
double-sided tape fixing it to the finder scope was failing. We found some more 
tape in the office and tried a repair.)</p>

<p> We may have also seen what may be the start of a "CAS Summer '06
M13 Time-Trial Competition." At one point Jagadheep loftily declared
that "It should never take anyone more than a minute to find M13 in the
scope," and was immediately challenged by Shianne to make good on said
boast -- he took 84 seconds (the dome had been moved to the appropriate
place before timing began).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, May 27, 2006</h3>

<p>While Friday had been a total rain-out, it cleared up just at sunset to permit
opening for the first of two special viewing nights for Graduation Weekend.
(Well, it <em>had</em> to--it's written in the contract that Graduation Day
has to have good weather.) A crowd of 25-30 all showed up at once about 9:30,
followed by no one for the rest of the night. While visitors were here we only
looked at Saturn and Jupiter; afterwards, Art and Shianne trained under Jagadheep.
They found M13 (Hercules Cluster), M92, and M12 (two globular star clusters),
but intense ground fog and 
mist were rolling in and we had to close for fear of moisture damage to the scope.
(There was also a misalignment problem with the Telrad finder, which caused a 
temporary halt to proceedings. Problems would continue over the next few days.)</p>
<p>We also took another peek at Jupiter later in the evening. The Great Red
Spot was quite magnificent in the direct center of the planet's disk, and we were
able to see another storm (maybe "Red Spot Jr."?) near it. We also observed a 
transit by one of the moons, including moonrise over the planet.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, May 24, 2006</h3>

<p>Art opened with the intention of training a bit on some Virgo galaxies, but
the clouds came in with their edge rolling by so as to <em>exactly</em>
cover Virgo and Leo--even Shianne gave up in discouragement. Art did
manage to find the galaxy M59 just after she left, then in frustration looked 
at Jupiter, just to be able to say he'd seen <em>something</em>. However, he 
then had a "Duh!" moment of insight, and decided to train on objects in parts
of the sky that did not have clouds... He found M57 (Ring Nebula), M56 (a
nice globular cluster between Lyra and Cygnus), and M29, a rather pointless
open cluster of six stars at the center of the cross of Cygnus. Pon brought
his girlfriend by and they took over observing, closing some unknown time
later.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 23, 2006</h3>

<p>After a week of clouds, Cornell turned on the weather machine in preparation 
for graduation and the overcast skies parted. Mike showed some guests a few objects, 
including Jupiter and the Galilean satellites, and Antares.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 19, 2006</h3>

<p>Despite clouds on the horizon, we got in a good 2 hours' viewing before they shut 
us down. About 20 people came in by then; we saw Saturn, Jupiter, M13 (Hercules Cluster), 
and M104 (Sombrero Galaxy). We could <em>just</em> resolve Castor (multiple star 
system) in the telescope, while M44 (Beehive Cluster) was viewed through the binoculars. 
Just as the clouds were moving in for good, some 10-12 people who had squandered  
the chance to show out-of-town guests the wonders of the universe in order to catch 
the opening night of <span class="title">The Da Vinci Code</span> showed up, and were told in 
loving detail all that they had missed...</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 12, 2006</h3>
<p>It's amazing how many people come up here when it's cloudy! We were able to see the Moon 
and Saturn through the scope, but only briefly. Other than that, we entertained the small but 
steady stream of visitors by pointing out the stars, one by one, as the clouds allowed. At 
least it was warm. (Oh, and we're back to Mike's classical stuff again. Apparently he 
got enough sleep last night.)</p>
<p>After closing due to clouds, Mike and Shianne lingered just long enough for more guests 
to arrive. Eventually the skies cleared again as more people arrived and we looked at 
M3 (a globular star cluster) and M13 (Hercules Cluster) through binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 8, 2006</h3>
<p>Another special opening, this time at the request of the Kappa Delta sorority, for 
the "Observatory Date Night". Decorations were put up, tables were moved, and appetizers 
were provided by two sorority sisters in what was a fun and successful night. The crowd 
was well behaved and much impressed by Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, M15 (a globular star 
cluster), M44 (Beehive Cluster), and of course, our borrowed laser pointer (which works 
great, by the way). Jupiter was very clear tonight, with the Great Red Spot easily 
visible.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, Mike, tired from a long night of 'Fortran-ing', gave in to 
Shianne and allowed her control over the music, resulting in a lot of tacky 80's music 
emanating from the dome.<br />
For the record and despite being called a "heartless robot," Shianne must say that Mike 
has horrible taste in music and doesn't know what he's talking about.</p>

<h3>Saturday, May 6, 2006</h3>
<p>This was a special opening in honor of Astronomy Day. Clear skies and
a waxing first-quarter moon provided for fair observations, despite poor
seeing. We saw
Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, M5, M55,
M56 (three globular star clusters), the International Space Station, and one
extremely bright fireball.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 5, 2006</h3>
<p>Clear if hazy, with a half-moon. About 100 people came through, peaking around
 10:00 PM. We looked at the Moon, Saturn, M3 (a globular star cluster), Jupiter,
 and fragment C of Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. We also looked at M44 (Beehive
 Cluster), M35 (an open star cluster), and M13 (Hercules Cluster) in binoculars.
 The treat of the evening, however, was a pass by the International Space Station
 (observed with the naked eye and binoculars)--most of our visitors were quite excited!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 29, 2006</h3>
<p>We viewed a very nice crescent moon; we could see craters on the part of Moon
 lit by Earthshine (really cool). The CAS members practiced finding deep sky objects
 (all galaxies unless otherwise stated):</p>
<ul>
<li>Art found M65, M66, M105 (had NGC 3384, NGC 3389 in the same field,
as seen through the 40mm wide angle eyepiece)</li>
<li>Bernadette found M95, M96</li>
<li>Jagadheep found M109, M108, M97 (Owl Nebula)</li>
<li>Shianne found M106</li>
<li>Jagadheep found M94, M63 (Sunflower Galaxy)</li>
<li>Bernadette found M53 (a globular star cluster)</li>
<li>Art and Jagadheep found M64 (Black Eye Galaxy)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shianne found comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 in about 15-20 minutes. She challenged
 Mike to find the comet sooner. Taking up the challenge, he found the comet in 2.5 minutes.</p>

<p>We also viewed numerous objects including M44 (Beehive Cluster), Jupiter, Saturn,
 and M4 (a globular cluster) through binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 28, 2006</h3>
<p>After Krzysztof gave a lecture on star formation, we <em>finally</em> had a
 scheduled public viewing night. 200-300 people showed up, and some asked some
 interesting questions. Because of the long lines we only saw the Moon, Saturn,
 and Jupiter.</p>

<h3></h3>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 8, 2006</h3>
<p>Art asked Mike if he could open for training; it turned into an unofficial
 open night, being the first clear (if moonlit) night in a while. About 10
 visitors came by in twos and threes. We observed Saturn and Jupiter multiple
 times (including a moonrise over the planet), Mars, M42-43 (Orion Nebula),
 M35, M36, M37, M38 (four open clusters), M81, M82 (two galaxies), and M4 (a
 globular star cluster). We also saw two less popular objects: NGC 1907 (an
 open cluster) and NGC 1931 (a bright nebula). Attempts to find M97 (Owl
 Nebula), M109, and M108 (two galaxies) failed. Binocular observations
 included M44 (Beehive Cluster), M3 (a globular cluster), and M13 (Hercules
 Cluster). We closed down at 3:20.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, March 27, 2006</h3>

<p>The Cornell Astronomical Society's 2006 Messier Marathon attempt is
 described in more detail <a href="messier06.html">on its own page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, March 26, 2006</h3>
<p>An unexpectedly clear, moonless night began too cloudy for a Messier
 Marathon but provided for some wonderful observing nonetheless. Coming
 around 11:30, Mike located the galaxies M98, M99, M100, M85, M84, M86,
 M87, M89, M90, M88, M91, M58, M59, M60, M49, M61, and M104 (Sombrero
 Galaxy) along with a few NGC objects.</p>
<p>Though Mike knew he should have been resting for tomorrow's attempt
 at the Marathon, he couldn't resist the brilliant, clear sky. He feels
 very confident about tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 24, 2006</h3>
<p>The sky was remarkably free of clouds, although the seeing was not
 that great. Shianne found Saturn, and would have found M51 (Whirlpool
 Galaxy) had some shady character not taken the star charts. Jennifer
 practiced finding the Mizar-Alcor double star in Ursa Major and Jupiter.
 They looked at Jupiter through practically every filter before closing
 up for the night. The observatory was serene and peaceful, as most of
 the campus was deserted for spring break.</p>

<p>After spending the early evening entertaining guests in his apartment,
 Mike [the "shady character"] set out to observe from 1:30am until dawn.
 With the help of the much missed star charts, he was able to locate the
 following objects:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5%">M66 (galaxy)</span><br />
before clouds moved in (stratocumulus)!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, March 21, 2006</h3>
<p>Michael and Pon came around 2am to view the Virgo Cluster and stayed for 1 hour.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 17, 2006</h3>
<p>We observed M42 (Orion Nebula), Saturn, NGC 2264 (Christmas Tree Cluster),
 M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy), and the Moon. It was the start of spring break, so
 not many students showed up. There were about 25-30 visitors total.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, March 11, 2006</h3>
<p>At 7:00pm Art saw that the sky was (despite national weather forecasts
 to the contrary) clear and called Mike. The observatory opened at around
 8:00pm; two young ladies who been jogging came by almost immediately (the
 only customers for the evening). We showed them M41 (an open star cluster),
 M42/43 (Orion Nebula; with the wide-angle eyepiece we could get both in the
 view and despite a nearly full moon could see an amazing amount of structure
 in M42), Saturn, M44 (Beehive Cluster) in binoculars, the Perseus Double
 Cluster, and M34 (an open cluster) before they got too cold.</p>

<p>Mike got M103 before leaving for a flight; Art stayed to train solo.
 While practicing starhopping to get M52 he got overtaken by clouds. M109
 couldn't be seen although he was sure it was in the viewfield. M3 was
 quite good -- the 40mm wide-angle was quite superior for seeing its details,
 compared to the regular eyepieces. Art tried to dial in M53 quickly as the
 clouds moved in for good, but was thwarted. He finally closed at 11:45.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 24, 2006</h3>
<p>Yet <em>again</em> the clouds arrived within an hour of opening, after an entirely clear 
day. We had about 8-10 visitors, but were only able to do M42 and Saturn through 
the scope, although several people were able to see some objects through binoculars: 
M41 (an open cluster), M44 (Beehive Cluster), M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), and 
the Double Cluster.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 27, 2006</h3>
<p>We spent an excellent evening listening to Mozart -- it was his 250th birthday -- but 
the observing was less reliable: after a <em>clear</em> day, clouds rolled in <em>exactly</em> 
at sunset to spite us. Nonetheless, there were some good seeing intervals, and we had a very 
good turnout for the first viewing night of the spring semester. Given the variable viewing 
quality and bunches of people coming in at times, we bounced back to different objects multiple 
times. The final tally was M42/43 (Orion Nebula), Saturn, M44 (Beehive Cluster), and Mars. 
Mike, after most customers left, went for a number of Leo galaxies since they were high up: 
M95, M105, M96, M65, M66, and NGC 3389. As clouds rolled in for good at 1:20, we ended with the 
Kyrie Fugue from the Requiem, having done a wide selection of movements/arias/pieces -- 
piano concertos, string quartets, operas, and symphonies (we did not do the Jupiter Symphony, 
but Jupiter was not visible anyway).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, January 23, 2006</h3>
<p>A wonderfully clear, moonless night allowed for excellent solo observing as classes resumed 
at Cornell. It is amazing how much more can be seen in the absence of moonlight! The nebulae and 
galaxies were very obvious, although Mike was unable to see M33 (Triangulum Galaxy) through 
binoculars. Saturn was particularly lovely, leading Mike to decide that the 
dome door should remain closed when observing to avoid turbulent seeing.</p>
<p>Other observing targets included M78 (a reflection nebula, very obvious tonight),
M42/43 (Orion Nebula), M50 (an open cluster), M1 (Crab Nebula), M48 (another open cluster), 
M44 (Beehive Cluster), and M97 (Owl Nebula). Mike saw a whole set of extraordinary galaxies: 
M51 (Whirlpool Galaxy), M101 (Pinwheel Galaxy), M65, M66, NGC 3628, NGC 3605, NGC 3607, NGC 3608, 
M105, NGC 3389, NGC 3384, M96, and M95.</p>
<p>Saturn and the Beehive Cluster made a magnificent sight in the same field of view through 
the binoculars. It was overall a fantastic night from 10:00 PM till 2:00 AM. Mike found that 
the vastness and great scale of space made his suffering on the first day of the semester 
insignificant and petty in comparison.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, January 19, 2006</h3>
<p>The forecast predicted a clear evening for solo observing, but skies clouded over soon 
after the observatory opened. The skies began to clear as soon as Krzysztof finished closing 
up, proving conclusively Mother Nature's malice.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, January 16, 2006</h3>
<p>Clear skies and a waning gibbous moon allowed for a cold but decent night of observations, 
although the first 5 hours of darkness were missed as Mike dined with a friend and his 
family. Shianne searched for M93 (an open star cluster) and eventually found it. Mike 
located it again from &delta; Canis Majoris in a 3-minute timed exercise. Next we observed 
&omicron;<sub>2</sub> Eridani, a remarkable triple star consisting of an orange dwarf,
a white dwarf, and a red dwarf. Shianne left early, but Mike observed until 2:30 am and
bagged Saturn, M78 (a reflection nebula), NGC 2169, NGC 2158 (two open star clusters),
NGC 2392 (Eskimo Nebula), and M35 (another open cluster).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 13, 2006</h3>
<p>We attempted to have a public viewing for a little while before forecasted clouds moved 
in, opening at 6:30pm. Art set up M42 (Orion Nebula) for the public; Mike tried for 
M78 (a reflection nebula) but was foiled by the glare of the full moon. Friday the 
Thirteenth manifested itself in the form of steadily increasing clouds; we tried to put 
in a filter for Mars but ran into overcast skies just as three visitors showed up. We closed 
at 8pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, January 12, 2006</h3>
<p>We held another training session, this time with completely clear weather but a nearly 
full moon. We attempted M33 (Triangulum Galaxy) but failed to find it; we did 
get M41 (open star cluster) and M79 (globular star cluster). We could see Saturn and 
the Beehive Cluster (M44) in the same field of view with binoculars. Shianne tried for
M93 (another  open cluster) without luck. Art tried for galaxies (M108, M109, M51) in
binoculars with the same results. A few visitors stopped by briefly at times.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, January 10, 2006</h3>
<p>After another stretch of cloudy weather we held a short training session, finding the 
galaxies M81 and M82.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, January 3, 2006</h3>

<p>After a long stretch of cloudy, rainy, snowy nights, the third night of 2006 provided for 
3 hours of clear, moonless skies. The forecast was for mostly cloudy skies, but I, Michael Roman, 
used my superior forecasting skills to anticipate and take advantage of the clearing. To give 
credit where credit is due, I simply consulted the GFS and 
Canadian <a href="http://www.cleardarksky.com/c/IthacaNYkey.html">Clear Sky Clock</a> models 
for the forecast, which were predicting a clearing since Sunday night. I used the solo 
opportunity to hunt for galaxies: M81, M82, NGC 2959, M108, M97 (not a galaxy; Owl Nebula), 
M109, M106, M94, M63 (Sunflower Galaxy)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, December 17, 2005</h3>

<p>This was a training session organized in part to test some new equipment we had received, in 
particular a new wide-field eyepiece. We looked at M42/M43 (Orion Nebula), the Pleiades, 
NGC 2264 (Christmas Tree Cluster), the Moon, Saturn, and M41 (an open star cluster). Viewing was 
not particularly good despite clear skies because the moon was two days after full and because 
there was plenty of water vapor in the air. On the other hand, the eyepiece performed very 
well, showing wider parts of the sky than previously possible.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, December 16, 2005</h3>

<p>Evening snow gave way to clear skies for about an hour before clouds returned. 
Having run afoul of Mother Nature, Mike spent his first evening of winter 
break shoveling unbelievably dense snow under cloudy skies after opening at 10pm. 
The only two visitors to show up were shown Mars, M42 (Orion Nebula), and the Moon during the 
brief clearness. Beethoven's birthday was observed with string quartet recordings.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 25, 2005</h3>

<p>The night was variably cloudy. Most people were away on Thanksgiving break; the only two 
visitors were friends of Art. We ended up closing early after observing Uranus, Mars, M38, 
NGC 1907, M36 (three open star clusters), and a most spectacular meteor that was visible through 
the clouds.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 11, 2005</h3>

<p>After Krzysztof gave a lecture on near earth objects, we saw the Moon, Mars, M36, 
M37, M38 (three open star clusters), and M1 (Crab Nebula).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 4, 2005</h3>

<p>The night was cloudier than expected, but we were still able to get some good
 observing done. The clouds acted as a natural filter and helped make details on
 Mars much easier to see. After the weather cleared up we looked at M35, M36, M37,
 M38 (four open star clusters), and M1 (Crab Nebula).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, October 29, 2005</h3>

<p>About 15-20 visitors came to our public night. The weather started cloudy but
 cleared up, allowing us to see M13 (Hercules Cluster), Mars, and M31 (Andromeda
 Galaxy). "After hours" observing also bagged M42 (Orion Nebula), M78 (a reflection
 nebula), M35 (an open star cluster), Saturn, M44 (Beehive Cluster), M67, and
 M41 (both open clusters).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 21, 2005</h3>

<p>Although the night was fairly cloudy/hazy, we had the first public viewing
 night in nearly a month. A fair number of visitors showed up (about 35). We saw
 Albireo (colorful double star), Uranus, and Mars despite the difficult weather.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 30, 2005</h3>

<p>Larry gave a lecture on extraterrestrial life; 37 people attended. The lecture
 was followed by observing under clear skies. We saw M13 (Hercules Cluster),
 M57 (Ring Nebula), Mars, and M1 (Crab Nebula).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 23, 2005</h3>

<p>Mostly clear skies. Viewed M13 (Hercules Cluster), M57 (Ring Nebula),
 &epsilon; Lyrae (quadruple star), Pleiades (through binoculars), and Mars.
 The night also featured 1 outstanding meteor.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 10, 2005</h3>

<p>Our training night was interrupted by an impressive auroral display; we managed
 to take some <a href="asphotos/aurora.html">pictures</a> (warning: large files).
 Practice targets included Vega, M2 (globular star cluster), M57 (Ring Nebula),
 and M72 (a fainter globular cluster).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 9, 2005</h3>

<p>Yet another clear night in a row! About 60 visitors showed up for our public
 viewing night, and we treated them to views of M13 (Hercules Cluster), &epsilon;
 Lyrae (a quadruple star), M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), and NGC 7789 (rich star
 cluster). We finished up with this year's first look at Mars.</p>
