<h2>Mars Through a Webcam</h2>

<p>This image was created by Rob West using a webcam attached to the Fuertes refractor. He combined 
approximately 240 frames picked from the 2-minute, 1200-frame video, then processed the result to enhance the 
contrast of the surface features. As a result, the image is <em>much</em> better than what visitors 
can expect to see in the eyepiece.</p>

<p>North is down (the Fuertes telescope inverts images); Mars's southern (top) hemisphere is slightly tilted 
toward us. The most obvious feature is Syrtis Major, the dark plain that stretches northward along the right 
side of the image. Syrtis Major is the most prominent feature on the planet, and often the only one visible 
to the eye at Fuertes. Hellas Planitia, a gigantic impact basin, is the lighter region above it.</p>

<p>You might notice that the center of the disk is much lighter in the image than in the simulation; 
this is probably what's left of the large dust storm that erupted in October.</p>
