<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2012</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. In the event that the lecture series is not filled, it is complimented with episodes of the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:00 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">The Hidden Ocean of Europa</p>
<p class="presenter">Bob Pappalardo (from JPL)</p>
<p class="abstract">
Jupiter's moon Europa may be a habitable world. Galileo spacecraft data suggest that an ocean lurks beneath its frozen ice surface. A paucity of large craters argues for a young surface and recent geological activity, and magnetometry confirms that a salty ocean persists today. Europa's ocean and surface are inherently linked. Tidal deformation of the floating ice shell generates stresses that fracture and deform the surface to create ridges and bands. Dark spots, domes, and chaos are probably related to tidally driven ice convection and partial melting. Europa's activity may permit the "ingredients" necessary for life to be present within the satellite's ocean. Astonishing geology and high astrobiological potential make Europa a top priority for future spacecraft exploration.

<p class="title">Celestial Navigation</p>
<p class="presenter">Adrian Poniatowski</p>
<p class="abstract">
The art and science of navigation by the stars holds an ancient and hallowed place in the human story. From time immemorial, the stone age explorers used the stars to propagate the human race throughout all the world. But even today, celestial navigation serves nautical, aeronautical, and terrestrial navigation in a host of essential ways that testify to the enduring relevance and utility of the subject. We will talk about the history and theory of celestial navigation, as well as the role Fuertes Observatory played in contributing to the subject.

<p class="title">Saturn's Giant Moon Titan</p>
<p class="presenter">Noah Warnke</p>
<p class="abstract">
The planets of the Solar System collectively have hundreds of moons orbiting them. Only one of these moons has any significant atmosphere, and that moon will be the subject of this lecture. Titan has had a very long observational history, but its extreme distance from Earth and ever-present blanket of opaque haze have presented serious obstacles to its study. Only in the last decade have we really started to understand this enigmatic body. We have found that Titan represents, in several important ways, the most Earthlike environment in the Solar System after the Earth itself. These similarities, along with some striking differences, will be examined in this lecture.

<p class="title">Failure Is Not an Option</p>
<p class="presenter">Gene Kranz (in Video Form)</p>
<p class="abstract">
Sept. 12, the day before the public memorial service for Neil Armstrong, was the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's "We Choose to Go to the Moon" speech at Rice University in Houston. That evening, Rice hosted a very moving and inspiring talk by retired NASA flight director Gene Kranz, the "buck-stops-here" guy during Apollo 13. (In the 1995 film, he was portrayed by Ed Harris.) Mr. Kranz gives a summary of the cultural context surrounding the early days of the U.S. space program, and a detailed insider's chronology of the Apollo 13 flight and the tremendous team effort to solve that life-or-death problem. CAS can think of no better tribute to Col. Armstrong's memory than by streaming the video of Mr. Kranz's talk as part of our grand reopening celebration.

<p class="title"> The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean </p>
<p class="presenter">Carl Sagan (in DVD form)</p>
<p class="abstract">
Almost everyone knows the name of famed astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan. A Cornell professor from 1971 until his death in 1996, one of his personal projects was the filming of a television series called Cosmos, which originally ran on public television in 1980 and held the record for most widely-watched series on PBS for the next decade. It addressed the history of science, and especially astronomy, throughout the ages, our findings about the universe, and the impact of this knowledge on humanity's past and future. We will be showing the first episode of the series, The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean, in lieu of our ordinary Public Lecture this week. This series is really a classic, and well worth watching!

<p class="title">Thirty Days Hath... Um, Er, Ahh...</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">
If you think trying remember the day of your mother-in-law's birthday is bad, you haven't even scratched the surface yet: Gregorian Calendar, Julian Date, Lunar Synodic Calendar, O.S. vs. N.S., Precession of the Equinoxes/Earth's Orbit... (never mind the impending destruction of Earth this coming December 21st by the rogue planet Nibiru--NOT!)

<p class="title">A Journey Through the Solar System</p>
<p class="presenter">Rick Kline</p>
<p class="abstract">
Rick Kline, Data Manager for the Cornell Spacecraft Planetary Imaging Facility, will take us on a spectacular journey through the solar system for this week's lecture. Kline has been flying the solar system for 25 years, and is well versed in the unfolding science of robotic planetary exploration. In a presentation of stunning images returned from spacecraft, Kline will share his extensive knowledge of robotic spacecraft missions to neighboring planets and entertain the whole family with images of our Sun, the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other celestial objects that share the solar system with Earth.

<p class="title">Spectrometry - Reading the Lines</p>
<p class="presenter">Noah Warnke</p>
<p class="abstract">
One of the most important scientific techniques for modern astronomy, spectrometry involves pulling apart light into its constituent rainbow and measuring the relative amounts of each wavelength ("color"). This measurement reveals a surprisingly large amount of information about the object and conditions that created the light, and about the medium that the light traveled through before reaching the instrument. There are numerous methods used for spectrometry, and numerous important findings resulting from it, including the expansion (and acceleration) of the universe, the chemical composition of stars and nebulae, discovery of new elements, characterization of planetary atmospheres, discovery of exoplanets, geology on Mars - the list goes on and on! In this lecture, we will look at the basics of light and the spectrum, at various techniques for measuring it, and at some of the more interesting pieces of information that can be obtained with spectrometric techniques.
