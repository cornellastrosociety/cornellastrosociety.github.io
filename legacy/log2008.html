<h2>What we saw</h2>

<p>This page will be updated frequently as we hold observing sessions. Editor's note: in
April, 2008, CAS acquired a 10"-aperture Dobsonian with computer
"push-to" control through SAFC funding. This allows us to have a portable telescope
to take to school outreach events and on other club trips. To differentiate observations
made with it versus the classic 12"-aperture refractor, we named it "Bob the Dob."
Several members had already taken informally to referring to the main telescope as "Irv,"
since its official title is the Irving Church Porter telescope, after its donor. Thus,
most log entries from April 2008 onwards refer to "Bob" and "Irv."

<h3>Wednesday, August 19, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art brought by a family member who writes a short popular science column for
the newspaper on Staten Island, NY, to give him source material for a couple days. Showed him
some Sagittarius stuff (Ms 8/20, 21, 22, 24, 25), other DSOs (Ms 13 and 31; Coathanger;
Double Cluster; &alpha;-Persei Group), Neptune, Jupiter + three moons in a very tight combo
around it, gave him the nickel sky tour, and even taught him to find Jupiter in Irv.:-) Stayed
about 90 minutes.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 15, 2009</h3>

<p>
(Unofficial entry: CAS club trip down to Cherry Springs. Shianne, Pon, Brandon, Mike, and Art
left Ithaca at 6pm, taking the binocs, Bob, and Brandon's Schmidt-Cassegrain; got there 8:30pm,
left about 2:30am after a lovely waning crescent moonrise, and got back to Ithaca just
after 5am. Hazy at first with some worry of clouds, but viewing improved noticeably over the
night; the air was warm (didn't need winter clothes&mdash;only sweaters!:) and still, making
for great seeing. They saw A Ton O' Stuff&trade;: many open clusters and faint planetaries
they'd never seen (and sometimes had never of heard of), a pile of Sagittarius/Cygnus objects
including an entire side of the Veil Nebula, galaxies M31/32/110/81/82/33 and a really bright
NGC 7331, and, except for Brandon:-), a pile of meteors, Perseid or otherwise. A truly wonderful
evening!)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 14, 2009</h3>

<p>
A clear warm moonless night saw 60-70 visitors. At sunset Russell W. and Art began w. Mercury and
the season's last glimpse of Saturn; Brandon and Pon helped Russell outside on M13, Jupiter, and
M31 in Bob/binocs while Art got M80 and M8 in Irv; then there was Jupiter/moons/Spot/scar (now
getting very hard to see) in Irv, followed by Neptune, the season's first look at Uranus, and
Pegasus galaxy NGC 7331 looking very nice. Mike arrived at the end; late evening deck targets
included the &alpha;-Persei Group, &mu;-Cephei, the Owl and Double Clusters, M34, and M31/32 and
a barely visible M110. Closed at 0100.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, August 13, 2009</h3>

<p>
Beautifully clear night. Tonight Art finally got Saturn sans rings definitely, as well as Mercury.:)
As Mercury set through the sundry atmosphere layers it repeatedly flared like a distant
bonfire&mdash;so beautiful that he had to see how Saturn looked doing the same... which meant that
it now was dark enough that he <i>had</i> to stay for some Sagittarius DSOs so as not to waste
a good night.:-) M8 in Bob+18mm was excellent; he also got in Bob/binocs Ms 4, 80, 22, 20, 21,
24, 31, and 103; NGC 663, the Owl Cluster, and the Double Cluster; Neptune (couldn't decide if
it is barely visible in the binocs), and ended with Jupiter/moons/Spot to check seeing&mdash;excellent,
lots of structure in cloud bands visible using the 18mm, with only slight degradation in the 13.8
and 7mm. Closed 2200.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, August 12, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art came at sunset briefly to try to figure out what he'd seen the previous night; figured out
it was Mercury, tonight in the 7mm in Bob smeared into a rainbow of chromatic aberration.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 11, 2009</h3>

<p>
With a brief window of clear just at sunset, Art came by to try to see Saturn sans rings (today
was its equinox). After a false start, he saw something very briefly that had no disk. As
he was leaving, Shianne, Dean, and Mike took over in hopes of seeing Perseids; Russell W. later
joined them, and seven visitors also came by. They got a grand total of three meteors before
clouds moved in, and also got some brief glimpses in Bob of Jupiter, the Ring, and M31.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 7, 2009</h3>

<p>
A big surge of visitors, ca. 70-80, right at the start of the evening, then almost nobody. Hazy w.
increasing clouds. Targets: Ring, &epsilon;-Lyr., a bad view of M13, Jupiter + moons + Spot + scar,
and Neptune to finish. At the end, Shianne, Pon, Art and the last visitors were treated to a
splendid 22-degree halo around the Moon.
<br /><br />
(Irv's focusing mechanism has gotten to where it can slide out of focus under its own weight when
near the vertical, as we found when doing &epsilon;-Lyr. early in the evening...)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, August 6, 2009</h3>

<p>
Pon and Art did the last '09 Cornell Adult University viewing hours&mdash;just over a dozen
visitors. Targets: Moon, Jupiter + moons, Ring, Owl Cluster, Neptune, M13, M27 (barely!), and
M51 (barely!). The solution to the "5th Jovian moon mystery:" there's the arc of three 6th
mag. stars just north of Deneb Algedi. Jupiter has been retrograding in front of 45 Cap., the
bottom star of that arc, so that several nights it happened to be exactly on the same line as
the moons. Given both the moon pollution and Jupiter right next to it, it looked yellow-white,
i.e., exactly like another moon...
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, August 5, 2009</h3>

<p>
A beautifully clear night either perfected or ruined by a blazing full moon, depending on one's
desires. For a bit over an hour, Art looked for things in Bob/binocs that could stand up against
a full moon, so as to have a broader set of viewing targets for moonlit nights. In addition to
Ms 57, 13, 5, 3, 27 (just barely, in binocs! If one didn't know it was there, would miss it
entirely), 103, and 22 (also just barely, in binocs), and the Owl Cluster, he found a couple of
open clusters in Cygnus/Lyra that looked okay: Ste11 (one of the corners of Lyra's parallelogram),
Ro5 (too wide for anything except binocs), V568 (binocs or Bob + 32mm only), and NGC 6871 and its
neighbor OCs Bi1 and Bi2. At the end, he and Shianne were treated to a repeat showing of "The
Mystery of the 5th Jovian Moon," and they fondly retired the CAS log book that has been in use
since October, 1992...
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 4, 2009</h3>

<p>
Shianne, Pon, and Dean opened for Cornell Adult University and had "about 27.6 people show up.
(Dean was a little out of it.)" Due to haze and clouds, they could only show folks Jupiter and
the Moon. "Some interested high school girls showed up just before closing, asking good
questions. Pon made sure to correct their astronomy/astrology confusion.:-)"
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, August 2, 2009</h3>

<p>
The collision scar on Jupiter was supposed to be visible abound 2323 EDT, but after being
completely cloudless at sunset, it was almost overcast at 2245. After about 45 minutes of
being toyed with, Art finally saw it clearly in Bob using the 13.8 and 7mm eyepieces&mdash;could
not make it out in Irv with the 18 or 26mm eyepieces, even using a filter. The Red Spot was
visible, plus <i><b>five</b></i> moons...?!!??
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 31, 2009</h3>

<p>
Cleared after a day of rain; another ca. 80 visitor night. Much Moon; good helping of Jupiter +
its moons (no Spot or impact scar); Neptune, Ring, Dumbbell, &epsilon;-Lyr., Albireo, a
barely-visible M31 in the haze, and the Owl Cluster to end. Mike and Art stayed open about 40 min.
late for someone who'd just defended her Ph.D. dissertation that day and arrived with her family
just before midnight.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 29, 2009</h3>

<p>
Another Cornell Adult University viewing night, a bit hazy but some visibility. Pon, Shianne,
Russell W., Armand, and Dounan showed people the 1st-quarter Moon, M57, M13, and Jupiter, incl.
Red Spot, and also doodled Jupiter and its "Great Green Spot" onto the dome using a laser pointer.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 24, 2009</h3>

<p>
The Apollo 11 splashdown 40th anniversary at least had pretty clear skies at first; we got 80-90
visitors. A very nice crescent moon in Bob/binocs even before sunset. Other targets: &epsilon;-Lyr.,
Ms 57, 13, 31/32, 8/20, Rocking Horse, Owl Cluster, Jupiter + 4 moons + Red Spot (recent "scar"
from the collision about a week ago not visible), Neptune, and a couple of Sagittarius objects
unidentifiable due to the bad haze by then. Closed, 0040.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, July 22, 2009</h3>

<p>
Shianne and Pon opened in the afternoon for solar observing for two school groups from the Vestal
area. "There were no sunspots and the clouds kept interfering, so the kids were more interested in
our eccentric tour of the building more than anything else."
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 20, 2009</h3>

<p>
We'd announced special public viewing hours for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing,
but once again the clouds played with us as a cat does its prey. In the first teasing clear moment
got Arcturus, Vega, and &epsilon;-Lyr. (to say had seen <i>something</i>), and in the second one
got Ms 3, 27, and 57, an ISS pass, Albireo, and the Rocking Horse. Only one visitor came by, and
that was during a cloudy patch. Closed in disgust at 2215.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, July 16, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art stopped by late and, while Shianne read oceanography downstairs, got about 30 min. fast binocs
practice in: Ms 8/20/21, 24, 23, 18, 17, 16, 11, 26, 14, 10/12, 5, 3, 9, 25, 28, 22, 71, 27, 103,
34 (1st time this season), 31, 52; the Double Cluster, NGC 663, the Owl Cluster (entirely visible
in the industrial binocs if one's eye is dark-adapted!), and several other unidentified open clusters
run over while failing to find Ms 76 and 81. (And, of course, a peek at Jupiter + moons...) As he was
leaving, three guys were walking out on the driveway so he gave them a 5-minute naked-eye nickel
sky tour.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 14, 2009</h3>

<p>
Pon and Shianne showed "about 40 enthusiastic people" from Cornell Adult University Saturn and M13
in Irv for Bastille Day, "then pondered the balloon animals they left as we were closing up..."
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 10, 2009</h3>

<p>
Very hazy until late in the evening; about 80 visitors tonight. Irv targets were M13, M57,
&epsilon;-Lyr., and Jupiter + 4 moons; in Bob and the binocs we showed M81, M31, the Coathanger,
&omicron;-Cyg., the Dumbbell, and also M57 and &epsilon;-Lyr. After the last visitors left at 0035,
everyone was horribly embarrassed by completely failing to notice the gorilla walking through
the psych experiment, to Pon's great amusement...
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, July 8, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art came to check a couple of things for the star-hopping guide; Shianne came by a little later.
Bob's finder/Telrad had gotten badly misaligned in the interim and couldn't get recalibrated
until moonrise. Meanwhile, in the industrial binocs we could see Ms 81/82, 4, 8/20, 6, 5, and 3.
Eventually got the Ring Nebula in Bob and decided it is <b><i>not</i></b> visible in the binocs,
even masquerading as a star.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 26, 2009</h3>

<p>
Jenn's farewell party. While the video game "Rock Band" was played in the classroom, about 50 visitors
came by on another "clear" night: Bob's finder and the binocs completely dewed up early. The evening's
targets were the Moon,
Saturn + Titan, M5, &epsilon;-Lyr., M81/82, Albireo, M57, M 8/20, M71, M27, and the Rocking Horse. Mike
and Art stayed open a ways past midnight to get some of those for a couple of international grad students
on their first (and only&mdash;they were to go home in a couple of days) visit to Fuertes; by the time
they closed at 0100, "Rock Band" was still going strong with no signs of decrescendoing...
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, June 24, 2009</h3>

<p>
Johannestag/St. John's Day, a.k.a. Midsummer's Day. A lovely crescent Moon at the evening's start.
Moe got some training, getting the Moon and Saturn + Titan in Bob, then finding M3 in Irv. Shianne
took over Irv for a couple of hours, leisurely finding the Dumbbell Nebula, NGC 6882 ("which wasn't
too impressive"), NGC 6940 ("which <u>was</u> impressive, for an open cluster"), and NGC 6934
("which looked more like a nebula than a globular cluster"). Out on the deck Art did a "quarter-peal"
Messier marathon&mdash;mostly in the industrial binocs but a bit in Bob. Gotten in Bob were Ms 65/66,
51 + buddy NGC5195, 109 (barely), 97 (barely), 57, and the Owl Cluster; in binocs were Ms 4, 80,
81/82, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8/20, 24, 21, 28, 22, 25, 19, 62, 23, 17, 16, 18, 9, 10/12, 14, 29, 56, 27, 71,
39, 103, 52, 26, 11, 13, 92, and 54 barely. (M54 needs to be at culmination to be visible in the
binocs; Ms 69 and 70 are too low, and may well need Irv.) Also gotten in binocs were Albireo, NGCs
663 and 6910 (Rocking Horse&mdash;can just make out part of the pattern), and IC 4665. As Art was
closing, Mike arrived from an evening out at Southern Cayuga Central Schools&mdash;Art guided him
to Ms 5, 10/12, 4, 80, and 29 in the binocs as he'd been skeptical. (It is clear that at least half
the Messier objects can be gotten in the industrial binocs, likely looking about as Messier and
M&eacute;chain saw them; looks good for marathoning next March!:-) They both thought the Ring
Nebula <u><i>might</i></u> be visible in the binocs; but if so, it's indistiguishable from a star
there. Finally closed at 0100: an excellent observance of Midsummer's Day.:-)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, June 23, 2009</h3>

<p>
Shianne and Dean came by, but were too tired after yesterday's camp-out to find more
than the Whirlpool Galaxy, M103, and M13.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 22, 2009</h3>

<p>
A "FUERTES CAMP-OUT" by Shianne, her friend Dean, Pon, Mike, and Jenn. While they noted that
"observing with dear old Irv" took place, apparently they were too busy playing the video game
"Rock Band" to write down what they'd seen...:-)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 19, 2009</h3>

<p>
Shianne's first log entry since returning.:-) Passing cirrus clouds made for poor observing
for much of the night, but clearer patches allowed us to show Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., M57, M13,
M8, M20, M22, M5, and M27. Clouds increased, prompting closing just prior to midnight.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 15, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art came by to check some stuff in Bob and the binocs for a star-hopping guide he'd begun writing.
The night being just too good to waste, he got on a roll and did a mini-Messier marathon
for two hours in them (finding <u>many</u> things in the binocs, perhaps due to the North Campus
lights being off). Got Ms 44, 3, 4, 5, 10/12, 52, 6, 7, 13, 66/65, 57, 51, 104, 103, 81/82, 92, 56,
97(!), 108, 22, 8, 20, 109, 27, 71, 94, 63, and "the pointless M29 and the worthless M40." He also
got the Coathanger, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., NGC 5195, the Owl Cluster, NGC 3953 (galaxy near M109),
IC 4665, and &Sigma; 1659. As he was about to start the Sagittarius M-objects Shianne, freshly back
from her exclusive engagement tour of Middle-Earth/New Zealand, came by with Jenn and a friend named
Dean for some terpsichorean indulgence. (They bemoaned having forgotten to bring sleeping bags so
as to have a sleepout on the deck.:-) Welcoming the excuse to break the "just one more galaxy..."
addiction on a work night, he gratefully ceded the obs...
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Sunday, June 14, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art stopped by about 1600 for some "quick" solar observing but forgot about a dome dead spot.
Fortunately Pon was able to swing by and help unstick the dome. (Not even anything to see on the
Sun for all that trouble, feh...)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 12, 2009</h3>

<p>
Amazingly, it cleared at sunset; a quiet night, about 25 people. Targets included Saturn + 4 moons,
the Ring, &epsilon;-Lyr., the Rocking Horse, Ms 66/65, 13, 104 (barely!, in binocs), 81/82 3, 4, 27,
the Coathanger, and Albireo. At the very end Ms 8 + 20 were barely visible in the binocs, plus a
couple other Sagittarius M-objects indistinguishable due to haze.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 6, 2009</h3>

<p>
Patchy clouds throughout the 3rd night of Reunion Weekend, with a rising nearly-full Moon; about 100
visitors. Saturn in Irv; out on the deck in Bob/binocs, it was Ms 3, 13, 81, 57, &epsilon;-Lyr., Albireo,
and an occultation of Antares by the Moon as the evening's highlight.
<br/><br/>
(Both junco chicks gone.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 5, 2009</h3>

<p>
A cloudy, rainy 2nd night of Reunion. The skies toyed with Bryan, Jenn, Lisa, and Mike, with tantalizing
bits of leeting up for observing; but by 2255 they gave up. About 10-20 people got tours of Irv, and Bryan
got a dry run of opening/closing.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, June 4, 2009</h3>

<p>
First night of Alumni Reunion Weekend. Crappy seeing between cirrus clouds and a nearly full Moon, but
still got 35-40 people through. At first it was the Moon and Saturn + 3 moons; after 2300 it cleared
enough to do Mizar/Alcor, Albireo, M57, &epsilon;-Lyr., and the Rocking Horse (which most people
thought looked either like a giraffe or an electric guitar).
<br/><br/>
(One of the two surviving junco chicks was hopping around the deck, having been able to fly down but
not back up; returned it to the nest.)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 29, 2009</h3>

<p>
"A <u>pleasant</u> change&mdash;only a 40-person night!:-)" Very hazy; things were dewing up. Also,
a nearly 1st-quarter Moon. We began with Bob on the Moon and Irv on Saturn + 3 moons. Later targets
in whatever included M81 (M82 was invisible), M44, M13, M57, &epsilon;-Lyr., Albireo, and a closing
find of the Rocking Horse CLuster (NGC 6910) by Jenn.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 25, 2009</h3>

<p>
(Unofficial entry: Pon + Art went down to Cherry Springs with Bob and two newly-minted graduates
who'd heard them talking about the place. The Memorial Day crowd had pulled out: other than two
people at the far end of the field, they had the entire place to themselves.:-) Saw Lots O'
Stuff&trade; before it started clouding up before 3am. Left Fuertes at 1730, back at 0610.
<br/><br/>
A second chick had hatched before they arrived to get ready; a 3rd had hatched by the time they
got back.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, May 24, 2009</h3>

<p>
A quiet night this time, 20-30 visitors; looked promising to start but clouds moved in. Saturn +
4 moons (Titan, Enceladus, Rhea, Dione) in Irv; M3 and M81/82 in binocs; and in Bob, &epsilon;-Lyr.
and an ISS pass, tracking it in the finder as folks watched. Closed, 2300.
<br/><br/>
(One junco chick has hatched.:-)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Saturday, May 23, 2009</h3>

<p>
Tonight Fuertes experienced the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field of public viewing nights: more people than
Mike or Art had ever seen. (Ed.: log entry begins, "<i><b>HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE!!! Gaaaah...</b></i>")
The <u>lower</u> bound on the estimate of visitors was 500: for over two continuous hours there were
60-80 people lined up out on the lawn and driveway waiting to get in! All attempt at crowd control
was abandoned; they simply kept both Irv and Bob on Saturn and tried to cycle people through as
fast as possible. Towards the end, because Saturn had become too hazy and low, they got M13, Albireo,
and &epsilon;-Lyr. in Bob and M13 also in Irv.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 22, 2009</h3>

<p>
First of up to three consecutive nights for Graduation Weekend; about 120-150 visitors. Started "clear"
but hazy; got effectively overcast by 2230 but then cleared up almost entirely. <b>MUCH</b> Saturn +
2, then 3 moons&mdash;by the end Saturn was "wearing" Titan like a party hat:-). As best we could
between clouds and people wanting to see Saturn, we also got Ms 3, 13, 81/82, 65/66, &epsilon;-Lyr.,
and the Coma Cluster. Closed at 0035.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, May 20, 2009</h3>

<p>
Back with a <i><b>REALLY</b></i> detailed star chart this time, Art finally had a confirmed sighting
of quasar 3C 273, and was sure that he'd seen it go by the prior couple of times he'd looked, too.
At over two Giga-lightyears distance, it was unimaginably humbling... He started with Saturn + 3 moons
for focusing (nice; pretty still air) and Ms 44, 81/82 in the binocs while waiting for full dark. In
Irv he also got Ms 65/66, 68, 104 (<u>very</u> nice; able to see the entire galaxy by wiggling the
view, and the dust lane was quite plain), and 83 (very tiny, only the core: looked like a globular).
He ended with more binocs practice: Ms 3, 13, 104, 4, 10/12 (just barely fit in the same view);
Albireo; &epsilon;-Lyr.; &omicron;-Cyg.; and the beautiful big open cluster IC 4665 in Ophiuchus.
Closed at 2300.
<br/><br/>
(Once again a junco has nested in a corner of the deck: 5-6 eggs. "Boy, is she gonna be unhappy the
next few weeks!")
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 15, 2009</h3>

<p>
It looked completely overcast but miraculously cleared&mdash;about 70-80 visitors. They got to see
Saturn + 4 moons, Ms 66/65, 81/82, 44, 104, 13, 57, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., and the Coma Cluster.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 12, 2009</h3>

<p>
With a more detailed star chart than <i>Uranometria</i>, Art came to try and see if the quasar 3C 273
is visible at Fuertes. A good clear night, with no turbulence. Saturn + 3 moons for focusing;
2 ISS passes in Bob&mdash;can see structures using the 18mm eyepiece, but the 7mm has too narrow a
field of view to get it unless the thing is going overhead (the first one hit altitude 87 degrees). In
Irv he saw M65/66, NGC 3593, and the asteroid Irene at the end. The quasar? He might've seen it: still
too many faint stars off the chart. He also failed to find galaxies NGC 4536 and 4527 despite their
being listed as magn. 10.6 and 10.5 respectively "with bright nuclei." One girl was lying on the lawn,
so he brought her up to see in Bob/binocs Ms 81/82, 44, 13, 104, 57, 3, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., and
the Coma Cluster. Closed at 2345.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Saturday, Apr. 25, 2009</h3>

<p>
Since "it seemed to be a good night to check out the observatory," Danny brought some friends. Although
he could only get the Ring Nebula for them due to clouds and haze, he reported that "they enjoyed the
night sky tour, the Ring Nebula, and the observatory itself!"
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, Apr. 24, 2009</h3>

<p>
About 100 visitors; clouds started coming in at sunset but cleared late in the evening. Various targets:
Saturn, Mercury, &alpha;-Persei Group, and Ms 81/82, 3, 13, 57, 44, 104, and 65 (very briefly&mdash;clouds).
After hours Russell W. and Art stayed to do M87; along the way they got M59 and M58. (NGC 4478 was not
visible.)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Thursday, Apr. 23, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art came to find galaxies and comets Yi-SWAN and T2-CARDINAL. He failed on both comets, and only found
galaxies NGC 4527, 4636, and 4643&mdash;the finderscope was badly misaligned to start and took too
long to fix. He also got Mercury and Ceres; then two women came by and he showed them a pile of stuff
in Bob and the binocs: Ms 104, 81/82, 36, 35, 44, 13, Saturn + 3 moons, the Double Cluster, and the
&alpha;-Persei group. Closed at 2300.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday, Apr. 22, 2009</h3>

<p>
A group of 50+ extremely enthusiastic and intelligent 7th grade girls from the Chapin School in NYC,
plus their teachers, visited for Earth Day. Alas, completely overcast: only able to get the cloudy
night tour despite trying to stall for time (turned out the "break" had been illusory anyway...).
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, Apr. 17, 2009</h3>

<p>
A large crowd, ca. 150. Much seen in this, that, or the other: Saturn (<i><u>lots</u></i> of it!) plus
all five big moons [Titan/Dione/Enceladus/Tethys/Rhea] (which, Mike noted, the Astro 102 students would
be tested on the next week :-); Mercury; Ceres; Ms 44, 53, 13, 66, 81/82, 57, 37, 36, 3, 104 (visible in
the industrial binocs!), and the season's last peek at M42; NGC 4565; and multiple stars 24 Coma Ber.
(blue-orange double), &Sigma; 1659 (sextuple star en route to M104: two concentric triangles), &iota;-Cancri
(carbon star), and &delta;-Corvi (very disparate double). Mike stayed after hours until 2am to attempted
some imaging.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Thursday, Apr. 16, 2009</h3>

<p>
Mike opened for an Astro 102 lab, showing people Mercury, M42, Saturn with Titan/Rhea/Dione (a good
cloud belt visible; the seeing was very good, with still air), M66/65, and M81/82. By the last, Art
had arrived to look at Virgo galaxies. He got M104 in Bob for Mike's students; then found Ms 49, 87, 86,
84, 88, 91, 90, 58, 59, and 60, plus NGCs 4365 (nice, bright), 4478, 4387, 4388, 4438, 4425, 4435,
4461, 4473, 4477, 4459, 4570, 4596, 4608, 4564, 4526 (better than some of the Messiers!), and 4550.
NGC 4474 was iffy, as was the find of NGC 3976 to start&mdash;had he gone back later for it, it
might have been definite, since it seems that with a clear sky and a fully dark-adapted eye one can
see well below magnitude 11 even at Fuertes.:-) To end, he got the Antennae Galaxies NGCs 4038-39
(VERY faint), and a refind of M104 in Irv&mdash;the dust lane was nicely visible and sharp. He also
grabbed the season's first look at M57 in Bob.
<br /><br />
(Notation: "There are waaaaaay too many galaxies in Virgo! Hadn't even done half of the list I'd
brought to check!")
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, Apr. 15, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art brought a visiting high school classmate and her family by and showed them Ms 44, 38, 36, 81/82, 66/65,
the &alpha;-Persei group, Melotte 111, the Double Cluster, Saturn &amp; Titan, and NGC 3628.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Monday, Apr. 13, 2009</h3>

<p>
According to the planetarium program Art had at home, this morning Neptune was to be in the same
position against the stars as the night it was discovered in 1846 (the program, it turned out,
was off by a year); so he came in at 5am to see. He got Jupiter and all 4 moons nearby for
focusing&mdash;it is unlikely he could've found Neptune before sunrise if it had not
been nearby&mdash;then got Neptune just NW of &mu;-Cap. Closed at 0530.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Saturday, Apr. 11, 2009</h3>

<p>
Cold but clear, with a bitter wind. Opened due to the miraculously-cleared sky, but none of the
dozens who called last night came by&mdash;two guys; then Russell R. brought a friend, but that
was it. Practiced instead: Saturn + 3 moons for focusing; the Leo Trio of M65/M66/NGC3628 (failed
to get the nearby NGC 3593), and M104 in Irv; Saturn in Bob using the 10mm was almost as good as
in Irv; and in binocs got Ms 44, 45, 36, 37, 38, 81/82, the Double Cluster, the &alpha;-Persei
Group, and the Coma Cluster (=Melotte 111). When Russell brought his friend, Art insisted he
re-find M65/66 to get some practice in.:-)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, Apr. 10, 2009</h3>

<p>
Prof. Richard Hennig gave an excellent talk on astrophotography to too few people; about 12 got the
cloudy night tour. Visitors' Weekend, so lots of calls to the hotline; if by some miracle it clears
tomorrow we'll try to open.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, Mar. 27, 2009</h3>

<p>
About 6-8 people got the cloudy night tour after Brian gave a nice talk on Titan to a small crowd.
</p>

<hr />


<h3>Friday, Mar. 20, 2009</h3>

<p>
Very cold but clear for the spring equinox&mdash;the winds at sunset thankfully stopped
soon. Like last Fri., a slow but steady crowd of about 25-30. Two passes of the
ISS/Shuttle seen, one just after sunset and the second at 9pm with Art tracking it
in Bob's finderscope while people took turns looking. (It got completely out of focus,
alas.) Things seen in this, that, or the other included: the beautifully and
extraordinarily thin crescent
Venus to start, Ms 42/43, 45, 31, 44, 35, 37-36-38, 46/47, 65/66, NGCs 2169, 2392,
Saturn plus 4 moons, Ceres, the Coma Cluster, the &alpha;-Persei group, and the
season's first look at the Sombrero Galaxy (M104) to end. While trying to dial in
the Needle Galaxy (NGC 4565) for some people late in the evening, Art found some
galaxy that might've been the Needle except the
surrounding stars didn't seem to match up right. Jenn had brought a friend by, and
since she hadn't found anything in Irv for nearly a year, it was imperative she
did&mdash;she got Saturn.:) After hours, in the new industrial binocs Art got M3,
M81/82 both very distinct, and the Sombrero might just have been visible at the limits
of visibility in it. (The Telrad is now again fully operational.)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, Mar. 19, 2009</h3>

<p>
The last full day of winter, so the temp. plunged over 30 degrees F at sunset,
causing the infinite line of cloud to come off Cayuga Lake again. Art managed to
see the ISS/Shuttle pass in Bob although he couldn't distinguish the two in the 32mm,
and hoped to try with the 18mm tomorrow. Before it became entirely overcast he got
M45 and (barely!) M31 in the new industrial binocs, just to say he'd seen some Deep
Sky Objects (DSOs).
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Sunday, Mar. 15, 2009</h3>

<p>
An excellent clear night, not cold. Art began with seeing the shuttle launch from
atop Mt. Pleasant with Rob West and wife Diane, then came to Fuertes to do Ceres&mdash;we
had forgotten to do it Friday&mdash;and to see how many "good" Leo galaxies are actually
visible in Ithaca. He first checked that the Crab Nebula was visible using the 32mm
eyepiece in Irv and did the Eskimo Nebula (NGC 2392), then got 22-23 galaxies over 4
hours.:) Finds included Ms 66, 65, 95, 96, and 105, and NGCs 2903, 3190/3193 (easy if
your eyes are fully dark adapted), 3226/3227, 3301 (easy, near a triangle of stars not
on the charts), 3384, 3389, 3412, 3377 (easier than M95), 3705, 3521 (bright core),
3607/3608/3605 (the latter listed at magn. 12.3!!), and 3626. NGC 2964 was extremely
iffy, and 3367 was probably wishful thinking. He failed to see Leo II, 3628, 3900,
3681/3684/3686, or 3344. (The last is listed as magn. 9.9; probably too wide, so low
surface brightness.) He also passed by the nice double stars &gamma;-Leo. and 54-Leo.
Ceres was bright and easy. To check whether these galaxies were visible because of
lights being off for spring break, he ended with a surprisingly difficult find of the
Whirlpool galaxy, but could not make out any spiral structure. (He did <b><u>not</u></b>
look at Saturn!) A fine way to spend the Ides of March.:)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Friday, Mar. 13, 2009</h3>

<p>
A quiet night for the beginning of spring break, with about 25-30 visitors including
a number of families with small children. It was mostly Brandon on Bob and Art on Irv.
Bob targets included Comet Lulin, M42/43, the Eskimo Nebula, the "37" Cluster (NGC
2169), M31/32, the Double Cluster, the carbon star &xi;-Cancri, colored double
&iota;-Cancri, plus the truly splendid crescent Venus to start (looked like a 2-day old
Moon) and the waning gibbous Moon to end. Brandon also found an unknown open cluster
in Casseopeia, which he believed was NGC 365, and installed the new industrial
binocs on the stand: targets included M42 and the Beehive. Irv targets included Rigel
as a nice obvious double, Pallas, M42/43, M35, M65, M66, and the inevitable Saturn
(plus 3 moons incl. Titan). (The Telrad has been reconnected but the display is not
working right; to be investigated during some day.)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, Mar. 3, 2009</h3>

<p>
Clear finally, but a killing wind from the northwest. In honor of Square Root Day,
Art opened at 7pm for training but no one came by. Irv's clock drive was again dead
from the cold. In Bob he only got M31 (no M32), M42, M103, the Owl Cluster, and
Venus for focusing before the wind became too much. Closed after barely an hour.
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Thursday, Feb. 26, 2009</h3>

<p>
Very hazy but clear for a little while after sunset, so Art got in ca. 40 min. practice
on Bob on early evening Messiers, etc., as marathon practice, and to do more diagnosis
on the calibration problem on his Push-To control. He got NGCs 2169/2362/663/457 and
Ms 48/50/35/34/42 before conceding&mdash;M31 was invisible and the nebulosity of M42
was barely visible. On the other hand, the 2-day old Moon was spectacularly nice before
it sank into the approaching clouds, and Venus was an exxxcellent crescent.:)
</p>


<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, February 24, 2009</h3>

<p>
The first clear night in almost two weeks allowed a chance to see Comet Lulin (which,
if the orbital elements at heavens-above.com are to be believed, will reach an
aphelion of about 4.27 light years(!) in about 23 million years). Very
hazy and turbulent atmosphere&mdash;difficult to get stars in focus. Art arrived
at 7:20pm to check other things while waiting for it to get high enough. The Telrad
has been inoperable for a few weeks, making finding startpoints for star-hops somewhat
inconvenient, so he got lots of practice during a 2.5 hr. nonstop hop starting at
Rigel... Found the asteroid Pallas (first find of it in recent CAS memory),
M79, M42/43 and the rest of the Orion Sword objects (NGCs 1973, 1975, 1977, 1980, 1981),
M41, and another open cluster Cr140. He actually got Lulin in Bob, plus Saturn (with
Titan and another moon) and the lovely triangular open cluster NGC 2362. One person
came by and got help finding Lulin in binocs. (Other objects viewed in binocs included
M44, M47 at the limits of visibility due to haze, and the &alpha;-Persei Group.)
Mike arrived about 10:30pm with an Astro grad student, by which time Irv's clock drive
had failed due to the cold. After they saw Saturn and Lulin in Bob, Mike got them
in Irv for comparison despite the dead clock drive.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 13, 2009</h3>

<p>
About a 50-person evening, with a slow but steady stream of visitors.
Extremely blurry at first, but seeing markedly improved later.
A variety of targets included: M42/43, M31/32, the Owl Cluster (NGC 457), M45,
M46, Venus, the Xmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264&mdash;looked very funky with an OIII
filter on, but the nebulosity became distinct), the "37" Cluster (NGC 2169),
Saturn, the year's first glimpse at the Leo Trio of galaxies M65/M66/NGC 3628, and the
waning gibbous Moon at the end. Early in the evening Don Barry from Astro brought by
a visiting researcher from Armenia, who greatly enjoyed getting to actually <i>see</i>
things in a telescope; Don also showed us in Bob "the winter Albireo"
(later determined to be double star h3945) and a splendid little triangular-shaped
open cluster (later determined to be NGC 2362), both in Canis Major.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 6, 2009</h3>

<p>
A clear cold night with waxing
gibbous Moon. Nineteen degrees Fahrenheit and some hazy spots didn't scare away the
approximately 40 visitors who enjoyed an edge-on Saturn, the Moon, M42, and the Double
Cluster. Mike stayed at the end to look for Comet Lulin but was thwarted by Irv's
clock drive again failing due to the cold.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 30, 2009</h3>

<p>
On a very cloudy night, we managed to make out the Moon, Venus, M41, and M42. At
the start of the evening Art opened for a very enthusiastic group of about 20
elementary school kids and their parents from Moravia, who thought the Moon in
Bob was the most awesome thing imaginable:-) and who asked a bunch of great
questions afterwards. About 15 more Cornell/Ithaca folks came by before clouds
forced us to close.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, January 19, 2009</h3>

<p>
After several years of trying, Art finally managed to watch an ISS pass in a
telescope, using Bob.:-) Irv's clock drive was working, and he managed to get
Vesta before the clouds rolled in.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 16, 2009</h3>

<p>
A <u><b>VERY</b></u> Cold and Very Hazy night. Although Irv's clock drive was
given a lube job the day before, it was still too cold for it. We attempted to see
a Venus/Uranus conjunction with Bob but only got Venus: what had looked just what
we expected Uranus to look like in fact was merely an optical aberration in the
eyepiece. (We realized something was seriously wrong when "Uranus" moved around!!)
The very few visitors also got to see M42, M45, M31, NGC 457, and one of the Auriga
M-objects (Ed.: some days later determined to have been M36); Mike tried to find Comet
Kushida in binocs but failed. The combination of cold, haze, and lack of visitors
forced us to abandon dome at 9:45pm despite a "clear" sky.:(
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 9, 2009</h3>

<p>
Another "appears to clear in late afternoon then clouds over soon after sunset"
night, which dashed a last attempt to do early evening family
viewing hours for this holiday season. Irv's clock drive was working again&mdash;it
apparently needs lubrication, and had seized up due to cold&mdash;so Art began
opening him up... which caused clouds to roll in within 3 minutes. He and Mike
showed the 97% full Moon in Bob to one family group of 5 before giving up. (Earlier,
to check seeing, Art had gotten M45 and M42 in binocs. A poor haul for the evening.)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, January 3, 2009</h3>

<p>
Art tried to make good on some early evening family viewing hours, but no one
came by except one mother and son. He showed them the Moon in Bob and Uranus in Irv,
but Irv's clock drive then slowed to a halt despite being newly wound-up!
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 2, 2009</h3>

<p>
Given the enthusiastic response to CAS' special early evening opening two years
ago for the tenth anniversary of Carl Sagan's death, Art wanted to hold early evening
family viewing hours for the three Fridays closest to Christmas&mdash;only to have
a blizzard on the 19th and rain on the 26th. Today's prospects finally looked excellent,
but clouds zoomed in within a half-hour after sunset: he only got to show the Moon in
Bob to one family of three (plus Capella, at their daughter's request).
<br /><br />
Judging by the number of families who came by before Art could
leave, even after it clouded, and the number of people calling the answering machine, there is a
<i><b>LOT</b></i> of interest in early evening hours.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, December 28, 2008</h3>

<p>
A clear late afternoon sky, but plunging temperatures created the infinite line of
clouds rolling off the lake too often seen over Fuertes. Before they shut things
down, Art was able to see in Bob a Venus-Neptune conjunction (simultaneously visible
in Bob's finder), the season's last glimpse of M57, all three of M31, M32, and the
barely visible M110 in the 32mm 2-inch; in binocs M45, Jupiter, and Mercury; and in
Irv the beautiful double star &gamma;-And., M77,
and some barely visible speck at approximately the position of galaxy NGC 1055
vis-&agrave;-vis the two guide stars for M77. The highlight was the sighting of
Vesta in Irv: the first viewing within recent CAS memory of an asteroid.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, December 13, 2008</h3>

<p>
The day after the biggest full Moon of the year (Moon at perigee), there was so much
water vapor haze that on this "clear" night, only M31 was visible using the
32mm 2-inch.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, December 5, 2008</h3>

<p>
A clear but very cold night. The dome got stuck for a few hours but recovered once
pushed. While the dome was functioning Irv saw the Moon, the Orion Nebula and M79
(globular in Lepus). Bob balanced between Orion and Andromeda to entertain a light
crowd that totaled around 40.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, November 25, 2008</h3>

<p>
Art came by to practice with Bob and try to diagnose the calibration difficulties
with him. No solution on the latter; on the former, despite lots of haze, saw a
variety of targets over ninety minutes: multiple stars &epsilon;-Lyr., the so-called
"patriotic triple" &omicron;-Cyg., &gamma;-And.; a number of open clusters including
the Double, Owl, Rocking Horse, Ms 103 and 36-38-37, and NGCs 663 and 659; and
galaxies M31/32 and NGC 404, next to &beta;-And.&mdash;failed to see either M110
or M33. He ended with the Pleiades.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, Nov. 21, 2008</h3>

<p>
It cleared for a couple of hours after a cloudy day although hazy throughout: we
were able to hold viewing hours until 2145. About 20 people came by before the
clouds, and another 8 got the cloudy night tour. In Irv we saw Uranus, M57,
&epsilon;-Lyr., and most of the Pleiades; Bob also got the Pleiades and M57, plus
M36, M103, M31, Albireo, and the "patriotic triple" in Cygnus.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 7, 2008</h3>

<p>
A mostly cloudy night, but we were able to show about 15 people the Moon and the
Ring Nebula.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, November 1, 2008</h3>

<p>
The Russells got Mike to open for them and saw "a number of things, including
the first Orion Nebula of the year."
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 31, 2008</h3>

<p>
For "Halloween at the Obs" we held extended open hours beginning at 6pm, cut short
by clouds at 10pm&mdash;cobwebs, bats, carved pumpkins, good scary music, and dry
ice were in evidence, as well as candy for children. It turned out to be a slow
night for visitors, with only a few families and about 30-40 total visitors. In Irv
we got only Jupiter and Neptune, while with Bob we saw M57, M31/32, the Owl and
Double Clusters, NGC 752 (open cluster in Triangulum), and &omicron;-Cyg., the
so-called "patriotic triple." (Patriotic to U.S. viewers, perhaps: orange, white,
and blue stars.) The evening's highlight, however, was <i><b>clearly</b></i> the
light-saber duels out on the deck, using "real, working" light-sabers courtesy of
Darth Aldinger (i.e., Brandon), to appropriate bits of soundtrack.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 24, 2008</h3>

<p>
After a lecture by Stephen on the Large Hadron Collider, we expected nobody due
to a heavily clouded night. Instead, a large steady Parent's Weekend crowd prompted
a succession of cloudy night tours until we eventually had the confidence to seek
out the Ring Nebula (which was clear for about 30 min.). With Bob we looked at
Andromeda, M36, M38, the &alpha;-Persei group, and &epsilon;-Lyr. Overall, a larger
crowd than we've seen on some clear nights&mdash;wish we'd had more to show them!
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, October 23, 2008</h3>

<p>
Art opened for training in honor of Avogadro Day, but nobody came. He did some long
starhops for Uranus and Neptune for his own practice; he also tried to find Juno
but lots of faint stars not on the <i>Uranometria</i> charts were in the vicinity.
A Cornell cop came by as he found Uranus, so Art gave him the nickel sky tour and
found Jupiter (3 moons, no Red Spot) for him.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 17, 2008</h3>

<p>
A cold night; hazy at first, then got better. In Bob we saw Jupiter (3 moons), the
Ring Nebula, M31/32, NGC 7789 (open cluster in Cas., large but with many faint
stars), the Double Cluster, &omicron;-Cyg., &eta;-Cas., and a few other unlogged
double stars. New member Julia got initial training, finding Vega, &epsilon;-Lyr.,
and the Rocking Horse cluster (NGC 6910). Other Irv targets included Neptune, M13,
and the Ring; we ended this ca. 40-visitor evening with Uranus.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 12, 2008</h3>

<p>
Danny and his father returned to find a somewhat cloudy night. Art came by and found
Neptune, which was as much a dot as it's always been. The Moon was also a nice sight,
but even it could not withstand the power of the clouds.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, October 11, 2008</h3>

<p>
Danny brought his visiting father to see some things. A fantastic night (except for
the rather bright Moon), yielding Jupiter, M13, and the Pleiades: cool in both
senses of the word.:)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 10, 2008</h3>

<p>
As the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary Sciences 40th annual
conference convened in Ithaca this weekend, we had the pleasure of welcoming Dr.
David Grinspoon as our guest lecturer. An overpacked classroom awaited and enjoyed
his talk, "Climate Catastrophes in the Solar System." Afterwards, perfectly clear
skies allowed some planetary viewing&mdash;Jupiter (with Callisto shadow), Uranus, Neptune,
the Moon&mdash;as well as M31/32, M57, M45, and &epsilon;-Lyr.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, October 6, 2008</h3>

<p>
A training evening. Moe got initial training, finding Jupiter, M57, and Neptune
(with an assist: it looks too star-like). Before Moe arrived, Art checked seeing
to find Jupiter "very swimmy," but separation of the &epsilon;-Lyr. components was
<b><i>very</i></b> crisp; and he got open clusters NGC 6633 (Ophiuchus-Aquila border:
very big, to be seen only in the wide angle), NGC 6755 (in Aquila: "nothing to
write home about"), NGC 6791 (very faint, in Lyra), and M56. After Moe left, Art
got Uranus, the galaxy NGC 7585 next to it (at extreme limits of visibility&mdash;the
Uranometria guide says it's magn. 11.7!), and the galaxy NGC 7331 in Perseus. Being
a work night, he reluctantly abandoned a good night after moonset at 2230.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 3, 2008</h3>

<p>
A night shortened by clouds by 2230; about 40-50 visitors, following a lecture by
Anthony to about 20. We saw Jupiter, Neptune and the Pegasus galaxy NGC 7331 in Irv,
and in Bob got Jupiter (to use Irv for other stuff), M31, and the Double Cluster.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 19, 2008</h3>

<p>
Pon lectured on the entire universe, starting from Fuertes, in 30 min. (He talked
fast.:) Viewing followed; a healthy-sized steady crowd all evening, about 100
visitors. High cirrus clouds prevented quality observing, but we attempted to view
Jupiter, M57, M31/32, M13, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., and the waning gibbous Moon.
We were treated to a fine Moon dog to end the night.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, September 18, 2008</h3>

<p>
Prof. Nicholson as faculty fellow brought a group of about 15 from Alice Cook House.
They enjoyed a tour of Fuertes and the night sky courtesy of Stephen, Mike, and Art,
including Jupiter, M13, M57, M31, the Coathanger Cluster, and Albireo. Prof.
Nicholson stayed after with the CASers to end with a view of Neptune.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, September 16, 2008</h3>

<p>
An Astro 101 student named Marco interested in joining CAS got initial training and
found Jupiter; he wanted to get M28 but flew by without getting it. Stephen passed
his key-test, finding Cr324 and M25. Several Astro 105 students who came by got help
finding M57, M31, and M13.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 5, 2008</h3>

<p>
The first official CAS meeting of the year introduced many new potential members to
the skies at Fuertes. Pon gave a "how to lecture" lecture, then (despite clouds) we
observed through about 2300. Irv started at a Jupiter fading in and out of clouds,
then moved to M13 and &epsilon;-Lyrae. (The dome began to get stuck in the west; we got
it moving again but are not 100% confident it's fully unstuck.) Bob looked at Jupiter,
M31, NGC 404 (another galaxy in Andromeda), and Albireo. A large number of guests
came by tonight to start the semester off right.

(Editor's note: Not an official log entry since it didn't happen at Fuertes, but the
club trip to the incredible skies at Cherry Springs State Park could not be allowed
to go unmentioned. A dozen members in total&mdash;including new freshman Chris who
had come by the observatory and was convinced on zero notice to join us:)&mdash;convoyed
down, bringing Bob the Dob, Prof. Richard Hennig's larger Dobsonian, and Brandon's
Schmitt-Cassegrain, and stayed the entire night. We arrived in time for a mini-lecture
series by people from Penn State as part of the 1st Annual Cherry Springs Astronomy
Festival, meeting up with
CAS alumna Tanya in the process. After an extraordinarily beautiful sunset, we saw
just a<u><i>MAZ</i></u>ing amounts of objects, in both quality and quantity&mdash;far too many
things to remember. [The star Capella caused what has since become a running joke,
because while low on the horizon it appeared to look exactly like an aircraft coming straight
in, blinking alternately red and green.] We packed up just before 7am, stopped for
breakfast in Galeton, and got back to Ithaca just under 24 hrs. after we'd left.
Everyone voiced deep regret that Shianne was not among the group, even though Mike,
who had been in NYC visitng friends, had met up with her earlier that day before
driving out to meet us&mdash;she was staying with a relative for a few days before leaving for NZ...)

<h3>Friday, August 22, 2008</h3>

<p>
The first day of the new school year, and Shianne's final CAS evening/log-entry before
leaving for a year in Middle Earth,er,New Zealand. Only a medium-sized crowd showed up.
We entertained them with Jupiter and Jupiter entertained us with its Great Red Spot
(seen through a green filter) and a transit of Io. High cirrus clouds aside, observing
was rather dismal compared to a trip the previous evening out to Mt. Pleasant (whose
darker skies allow things like the Lagoon Nebula, M17, to look quite bright compared
to Fuertes). We saw three meteors, though&mdash;two of them rather slow.
