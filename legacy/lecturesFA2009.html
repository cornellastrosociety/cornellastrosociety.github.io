<h2>CAS Lectures Fall 2009</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">It's Not Easy Being Blue - How Space Has, and Will, Continue To Pummel Earth</p>
<p class="presenter">Stephen Demjanenko</p>
<p class="abstract">Ever turn on the News only to be shocked by how brutal the weather on Earth can be? 
Well, space is even less forgiving, since the forces involved with the more dramatic, but also more rare, 
events of our galaxy are much much greater - our existence on Earth is but a frail one. Recent (and not so recent) 
evidence suggests that life on Earth has long battled against comets, meteors, and even Supernovae...our own life 
giving Sun has been known to cause problems in paradise on occasion. If one needs more evidence as to what can 
happen to a planet, one need only turn to our neighbor Mars which is thought to once have supported an atmosphere 
much like our own, and maybe even life! Come be terrified and awed at what could happen!</p>

<p class="title"> This Is <u>NOT</u> Your Parents' Solar System...</p>
<p class="presenter"> Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract"> Dwarf planets, Kuiper Belt Objects, chaotic orbits, the Crater of Doom,
and now hot Jupiters around other stars... Many people long for The Good
Old Days(TM) when solar system astronomy was simple: nine planets going
around the Sun like clockwork, with just a couple of comets and some
asteroids being untidy. Well, how about the REALLY good old days, when
there were only seven movable things and a bunch of stars all going
around the Earth? The history of planetary astronomy encapsulates the
scientific process: as we get new data, we have to revise how we think
about things--and our place in the universe. And despite being literally
"pie in the sky," it _does_ impact policy. (Can you say, "dinosaur
killer?") Join us for a quick tour of how we learned about the solar
system, why the last 50 years has truly been _the_ Golden Age of
planetary science, and a bit about where current research is heading.</p>

<p class="title"> Space Weather</p>
<p class="presenter"> Bryan Scherrer</p>
<p class="abstract"> It's not often that we think of the Sun as a violent ball of nuclear
fusion. In our everyday lives, it gives us the light and warmth we use
to stay alive. Yet, our technology is incredibly vulnerable to solar
fury. Invisible clouds of ions float towards us, interacting with out
magnetic field, and wrecking havoc on electronics. The radiation of a
solar flare is capable of killing astronauts in an instant. On the
ground, power grids and oil lines face degeneration and destruction
when the Sun strikes. We're entering the next solar cycle, and unless
we prepare for it, the Sun will annihilate our technology and
livelihoods as it sees fit.</p>

<p class="title"> Quantum physics and Zen</p>
<p class="presenter"> Brandon Bass</p>
<p class="abstract"> Quantum physics is about expanding your mind, and disregarding
your preconcieved notions.  You have an impact in the world by just
existing, and only by opening yourself to the impossible can you begin
to see true reality and reach your own enlightenment.</p>

<p class="title"> The South Pole of Mars</p>
<p class="presenter"> Nicki Button</p>
<p class="abstract"> The seasonal polar caps of Mars is composed of CO2.  In the south some
CO2 ice is retained throughout the year, call the residual cap.
Observations in the 1970’s, 1990’s, and early 2000’s indicated some
year-to-year variations of the seasonal cap cycle and some changes in
the residual cap.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter carries several
imaging instruments which can monitor seasonal and year-to-year
changes.  We use Context camera data, 5 m/pixel, to compare two Mars
years of summer defrosting in order to evaluate climate and effects on
the underlying, older CO2 deposits.</p>

<p class="date">October 30</p>
<p class="title"> Chinese Astronomy</p>
<p class="presenter"> Hua Liu</p>
<p class="abstract"> The ancients once said that we can predict the future from the stars,
but through the stars, we can also see far into the past. Through the
western sky, we recall the many familiar myths and legends of times
long past: of how Perseus rescued Andromeda on the winged Pegasus, of
Orion and his faithful dog Sirius. Yet, as we leave the confines of
familiarity, gazing far into the east, we see another civilization: a
civilization rivaling ancient Rome and Greece in splendor, with its
own constellations, its own myths and legends, and its own way of
interpreting the enigmatic universe. Join us on a tour of the eastern
sky, where everything is familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time.</p>

<p class="title"> Who wants to be an Amateur Astronomer</p>
<p class="presenter"> Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract"> What are the trojan asteroids? Who was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth? Which planet is called the Morning Star? What does the LGM-1, the name of the first pulsar discovered, stand for? What celestial object does the word "Subaru" and the Japanese car company translate to?

If you know the answers to the above question, or would like to know, join us in this week's CAS lecture series spinoff event: "Who want to be an Amateur Astronomer". Inspired from the famous television show. Answer questions correctly and you could win up to ONE MILLION DOLLARS*. Ok, the monetary reward might not be real, but you are guaranteed to win pride and fun! Come test your general astronomy knowledge. Becomes the contestant and reach the top of our hall of fame.

*Some Restrictions May Apply.</p>

<p class="title"> The Oort Cloud</p>
<p class="presenter"> Brian Crandall</p>
<p class="abstract"> The Oort Cloud
 
Out in the solar system's limits lay some snowballs; millions of them. The Oort Cloud objects, like toys from a forgotten childhood, lie at the edge of our system, quietly hanging out, not doing a whole lot and seemingly not worth paying attention to. However, these snowballs actually are disturbed very easily...and that might send them on an unpleasant visit towards planet earth. You may think a snowball is no big deal, but I'll bet you'll start caring a lot more when a snowball the size of a mountain starts plummeting out from the sky. Join CAS as we take a tour of the icy limits of the solar system and its dangerous denizens.</p>
