<h3>Friday, May 3, 2002</h3>

<p>Tonight was pretty much like the past few Fridays. The five planets are
out, and Venus, Mars, and Saturn got closer. Mercury was higher in the sky.
The main scope was on Jupiter most of the time, though it was on Saturn
earlier on. The seeing was good. The C-14 was brought out, and proved its
worth by its very bright and crisp views of Jupiter, M3, M57, M5, and M13.
Comet Ikeya-Zhang was spotted near Draco; it was very bright and easily seen with
the binoculars. We had the C-14 on it for some time. We went galaxy
hunting later that night and bagged M51, M108, M109, M106, M94, M63, M81,
and M82--all in the vicinity of Ursa Major. Jagadheep caught the Owl Nebula
(M97), which was visible only through the ultra black filter.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 26, 2002</h3>

<p>Visitors started coming in even before sunset! Venus was the first target,
then Saturn, then Jupiter. We were slightly overwhelmed by the turnout
today and the C-14 had to be set up. By the time it was set up, more than
half the sky wound clouded up. It first pointed at Jupiter, then Jagadheep
tried to resolve Castor, but the seeing was less than perfect. The C-14 was
later turned to the Moon and stayed there till closing down.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 20, 2002</h3>

<p>We had a 4H group today. For those who came early, they were shown
the 5 planets--Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter in order of altitude.
The scope was first pointed at Mercury, then Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter.
Jagadheep saw Venus... We caught an Iridium flare (Iridium 83) at 9:20
passing to the right of Cassiopeia. M13 was the next object on the scope. After
that, the next hour or so was spent speculating on the function of a chopper
that kept going round the campus in a semi-random manner. The night
ended with two Iridium flares, spaced 10 minutes apart, on the bottom and
top of Vega, at 10:42 and 10:52 (Iridium 63 &amp; 64).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 19, 2002</h3>

<p>First clear Friday night in a while. Very warm, incredible seeing despite
moon. The planet lineup drew a huge crowd. Saw Venus, Mercury, Mars,
Saturn, and Jupiter. We also spotted the Sombrero Galaxy and M13. Stayed
late with two new trainees.:-) Glee Club/Chorus members came and provided
live music. Awesome time.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, April 7, 2002</h3>

<p>A clear fantastic night. Guanhan started off on Saturn when a few
visitors showed up. Jagadheep joined in at ~8:20 and then we started on a
chain of galaxies: M95, M96, M105, NGC 3377, NGC 3412, M65, M66, M98, M99,
M100, M85, M86, M84, M87, M90, M91, M88, M58, M59, M60, M49, M61, M89,
NGC 4550, and NGC 4551--25 galaxies in all!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 6, 2002</h3>

<p>First Friday [sic] open house after a long time. Wasn't a good night due
to patchy clouds. Objects seen were Saturn, Orion Nebula, Jupiter. Clouded
up before we got to M3.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, March 30, 2002</h3>

<p>First observing session after the renovation. The sky was not too clear, but
seeing was better than average. Caught Comet Ikeya-Zhang just below
&beta; Andromedae very low in the sky through binocs. It was not seen
through the scope, though. Went on to Castor, which resolved quite nicely.
Then we went to Pollux, which appeared as a single star. Finally ended up
with Jupiter. The equatorial bands were prominent along with two barely
visible thin bands on either side of the equatorial bands. Cloud cover was
getting too thick, so the dome was closed at 9:30.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 1, 2002</h3>

<p>First clear Friday night in quite a while, and last Friday night before the
observatory closes for some renovations (for a few weeks). Fair seeing, but
quite a crowd. Checked out the Eskimo Nebula, Saturn, Jupiter, and the
Moon. We also had an interesting group of not-so-sober students grace us
with their presence. We also prepped a slide show for tomorrow night,
practice for Funkosmic.</p>

<hr />

<h3>January 23, 2002</h3> (sic--entered after Jan. 26 entry; possibly
error for Sat., Feb. 23)

<p>We started with M79, a globular cluster. Visitors came and the scope was
turned to Saturn and Jupiter. Seeing was terrible as the bands of Jupiter could
not be made out. Fruitful night for globular clusters, though, as we saw M3
in Bo&ouml;tes and ended with M13 in Hercules.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, January 26, 2002</h3>

<p>We started off with Jupiter at about 8:30pm. The Great Red Spot was
transiting the meridian of Jupiter. Seeing was great. Visitors came and were
shown Saturn, M42, the Moon, and Jupiter. We proceeded to clusters in
Puppis and Canis Major--M46, M47, NGC 2362, Sigma Orionis, M41, and M93.
We went back to Jupiter in search of the shadow of Io, but turbulence
prevented its sighting.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 25, 2002</h3>

<p>CAS meeting. It was cloudy, but we hung around for lack of something
better to do. As it happened, quite a crowd of people wandered in just to
listen and look <em>at</em> the telescope. Great family &amp; their
German Shepherd! Sara finally came!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 18, 2002</h3>

<p>Despite meager predictions, there were no clouds but the atmosphere was
exceedingly turbulent. There were many visitors, but the cold kept us
primarily downstairs during any break in the public flux. We checked out
Saturn, Jupiter, M51, Sigma Orionis, M35, M42, plus sharing our winter
break stories...</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, December 21, 2001</h3>

<p>Periods of clouds and clear skies. No visitors. Observed M15 (globular
cluster), M31, M32, M110 (just barely saw it), &gamma; Andromedae, and
&gamma; Arietis.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, December 19, 2001</h3>

<p>More or less clear night with fast moving clouds in between. Observed
ET Cluster, Saturn, Jupiter, Orion Nebula, NGC 7782, M37 (two open clusters),
and the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 9, 2001</h3>

<p>First public viewing night since Fall Break! The weather was fair; very
hazy and cold.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, October 8, 2001</h3>

<p>A very clear night. CAS planned an "all-nighter." Started off on Mars,
then moved to M51 (Attila); very faint--could just see two fuzzy patches.
Tanja found Neptune and then Jagadheep found Uranus. Meanwhile, Edgar
had formulated a scheme for operating the piggy-backed camera and he took
a 15 min. exposure of the region around Cygnus. Then a short break with
waxed chocolate drink (Edgar poured hot water into wax cups meant for
cold stuff). Tanja tried for the Helix Nebula. She thought she found
something, though no one looked at it. Then onto Saturn, gorgeous with
at least six moons. Soon, Edgar left as he had to work the next day. Dounan
also left.</p>
<p>After Saturn, Guanhan pointed the 'scope at Jupiter; the Red Spot was
not visible (probably on the other side), but other bands could be seen. Four
of Jupiter's moons could also be seen. A few visitors came now and
then...</p>
<p>Later, after Orion was up, we pointed at the famous Orion Nebula.
Looked awesome with lots of structure visible. Took two exposures, one for
10 min., one for 15 min.</p>
<p>Turned back to Saturn for a few visitors who were taken aback when they
saw the rings. (They thought it was "unreal.") Later Tanja tried for M33 and
failed. Tired, we shut down at 3:45am.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 5, 2001</h3>

<p>Cloudy night; opened telescope onto ET Cluster when clouds broke
apart briefly to satisfy public. Tried to get at Moon; clouds finally ruined the
night after Guanhan focused on it.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, September 30, 2001</h3>

<p>Scattered clouds and a very big moon. Started with Mars, then the Moon
and M13. Edgar got training on star-hopping with NGC 6543 (Cat's Eye
Nebula). Then Jagadheep trained on M52 (open cluster in Cassiopeia).
Finished with the Ring Nebula and Saturn.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 29, 2001</h3>

<p>Big moon but beautiful night. Saw planets: Mars, Saturn (awesome!), and
Jupiter. Other stuff: double star &gamma; Andromedae and lots of open
clusters: M39, Pleiades, Double Cluster, M34, M38, M36. We got a small group
of visitors for a short time; showed the Pleiades and &gamma; Andr.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 21, 2001</h3>

<p>Bad open house... short. Small groups of people came... cloudy. We
showed M15 and NGC 457 before it clouded again.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 15, 2001</h3>

<p>Sunspot observation, 11am-1pm. Partly cloudy. We could identify the
principal groups and found that 9608 is actually the face of an alien smiling
at us.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 14, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house, but mixed night. It started out clear, clouded up a half hour
later. We entertained guests after showing Mars, then started shutting down.
Finally, around 11:15 it cleared up: awesome sky. Saw M33 and watched the
winter constellations rise. We have a new enthusiast in our midst. :-) The
club is growing.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 7, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house! The weather was quite sketchy, but since we had a CAS
meeting earlier we decided to stick it out. We saw NGC 457, M13, Dumbbell
Nebula, Albireo, and the Ring Nebula. The seeing was not good at all, but the
music and the company were great. We got quite a crowd, too, including a
past president of CAS!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 25, 2001</h3>

<p>Orientation night! Very busy crowd, but manageable. We had the C-14
out and showed M13, Mars, the Moon, Andromeda Galaxy, and the Dumbbell
Nebula. We have a few potential enthusiastic CAS members. Very
promising, or at least so it looks.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 24, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house! Pretty clear night. Showed many things, but in a rush.
Nothing new. Pretty good-sized crowd. Getting ready for the big night
tomorrow.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 10, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house once again. Fairly good seeing and a good bunch of people.
Saw Dumbbell Nebula, M3, Mars, Neptune, Uranus, and a faint M51. Perseids
peak tonight so there was also a fair number of meteors. "Much fun."</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 27, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house!! Cloudy at first, but cleared up around ten. Large crowds
today, though. Saw Moon (1st quarter), Ring Nebula, and Mars. Skies
around midnight were spectacular, though it is very cold for a summer
night. We <em><b>DEFINITELY</b></em> have to do something about the new
student commons--its light today was brighter than a full moon!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 20, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house! Saw Mars, Dumbbell Nebula, M51, and M13. Incredibly
clear skies--could see Milky Way yet again. Did some more prime focus
photography.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, July 15, 2001</h3>

<p>After cleaning up the darkroom, we took advantage of some really clear
skies and tried photographing by prime focus M51, M22, and Mars. Could
even see the Milky Way pretty clearly.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 13, 2001</h3>

<p>Friday the 13th! Open house! Partly cloudy and then clouded over. We
did do some good star tours earlier and looked at the Dumbbell Nebula.
Ended the night early (~11:30) due to cloud cover.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 9, 2001</h3>

<p>Wild Duck Cluster (M11), Blinking Nebula, and M51. A rather successful
night with satisfactory skies.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, July 8, 2001</h3>

<p>It was pretty hazy, but Attila found the Dumbbell Nebula for the first
time and Tanja pointed the 'scope at the Owl Cluster again (she still says
it's ET). Otherwise, plenty of music and dancing.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 6, 2001</h3>

<p>Open house! We had a very good audience and besides the bright moon
rising late, there were light and not-so-light clouds periodically. Shown:
Mars, Moon, NGC 457 (Owl Cluster), Ring Nebula, M3. After about an hour wait
in the haze, we spotted Comet Linear, about magnitude 4.5.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 2, 2001</h3>

<p>Came in late after Astro 105 lab, and found the Dumbbell Nebula.
Visibility: fair (moon too bright and light clouds). Next time we'll find the
ET Cluster!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, July 1, 2001</h3>

<p>Finally pulled the solar filter out of its hiding place and put it to good
use. Skies were very clear and 4-5 sunspots were visible. Unfortunately
the 11-yr. peak is over. While attempting for the Dumbbell Nebula after
twilight, evil clouds took over the incredibly steady sky, which ended
our observing.</p>
