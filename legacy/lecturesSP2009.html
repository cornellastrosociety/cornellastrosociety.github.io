<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2009</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title"> Navigating the Night Sky, or "I _Knew_ I Shoulda' Taken That Left Turn at Albireo!"</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">Bugs Bunny's navigational difficulties with respect to Albuquerque
 and Pismo Beach are legendary. How much greater, then, might your
 problems be in moving around the entire night sky? While you wouldn't
 be burdened by "tunnel vision" like Bugs, the sheer scope of things
 might seem daunting. Fortunately, a few easily-learnable constellations
 provide guideposts for each season. We will learn how to recognize
 these star patterns as seen from Ithaca, and how to use them to find
 less obvious constellations elsewhere in the sky; we will also briefly
 discuss celestial coordinate systems for use in binocular or telescope
 observing. In the (alas, unlikely) event of clear skies that evening,
 we will immediately follow the talk with a "lab practical" out on the
 observatory deck.</p>

<p class="title"> Understanding the Heaven </p>
<p class="presenter">Matipon Tangmatitham</p>
<p class="abstract">Understanding the motion of heaven has always been a great puzzle to humanity since the ancient times. This CAS lecture series will explore the motion of the planets and how it appears to us. One of the greatest mysteries about planetary motion was the retrograde motion. Understand the motivation behind the ancient astronomers. Follow the evolution of astronomy from the signs of zodiacs, astrology, geocentric model, epicycles and deferents, Copernican revolution, or how Galileo's discovery was frowned upon by the Catholic Church. Understanding the past will allow to understand how we came to realize the heavens above as we know it today.</p>

<p class="title"> Infinite Worlds, Infinite Possibilities </p>
<p class="presenter">Lisa Bacis</p>
<p class="abstract"> Have you ever imagined worlds outside of our own? That there is the possiblity of another Earth, dimension, or universe? Scientists have pondered the idea of parallel universes for some time now. But where did these thoughts begin? What possible evidence is there to support this hypothesis? The answers to those questions and more will be explained and shall soon open your mind to some extraordinary possibilities. </p>

<p class="title"> Space Weather </p>
<p class="presenter">Bryan Scherrer</p>
<p class="abstract"> It's not often that we think of the Sun as a violent ball of nuclear fusion. In our everyday lives, it gives us the light and warmth we use to stay alive. Yet, our technology is incredibly vulnerable to solar fury. Invisible clouds of ions float towards us, interacting with out magnetic field, and wrecking havoc on electronics. The radiation of a solar flare is capable of killing astronauts in an instant. On the ground, power grids and oil lines face degeneration and destruction when the Sun strikes. We're entering the next solar cycle, and unless we prepare for it, the Sun will annihilate our technology and livelihoods as it sees fit. </p>

<p class="title">Titan</p>
<p class="presenter">Brian Crandall</p>
<p class="abstract">The solar system is a very intriguing place. Perhaps one of the most
amazing worlds that comprise our little pit stop in the universe is Titan,
a Saturnian moon where the smog is so thick and filthy it makes our
dirtiest cities look like a refreshing paradise. This little ball of rock
and sewer gas changes weather enough to make the local weatherman
employed�if he could tolerate the -300 F degree temperatures, icy
continents, methane downpours and the possibility the whole thing might
roast into a cinder if the conditions are right. And you thought our air
was bad. Join us this Friday at Fuertes Observatory for a tour of our
solar system�s of Titan, the powder keg of the solar system.</p>

<p class="title"> It's Not Easy Being Blue - How Space Has, and Will, Continue To Pummel Earth  </p>
<p class="presenter">Samuel Johnson Stoever</p>
<p class="abstract">Ever turn on the News only to be shocked by how brutal the weather on Earth can be? Well, space is even less forgiving, since the forces involved with the more dramatic, but also more rare, events of our galaxy  are much much greater - our existence on Earth is but a frail one. Recent (and not so recent) evidence suggests that life on Earth has long battled against comets, meteors, and even Supernovae...our own life giving Sun has been known to cause problems in paradise on occasion. If one needs more evidence as to what can happen to a planet, one need only turn to our neighbor Mars which is thought to once have supported an atmosphere much like our own, and maybe even life! Come be terrified and awed at what could happen!</p>

<p class="date">April 10</p>
<p class="title"> Astrophotography: How to create beautiful pictures of heavenly bodies</p>
<p class="presenter">Richard Hennig</p>
<p class="abstract">Ever wondered how you can create such beautiful pictures of the moon, planets, star clusters, galaxies and nebulae as you can find in books, magazines and on the web?  Come and learn how to simply use your digital or film camera to capture the motion of the stars throughout the night sky and how to use mounts and telescopes for long time exposures of faint galaxy clusters and colorful nebulae and solar system objects.  We will delve into the various photography techniques and discover what equipment you need for the pictures of various celestial objects.</p>
<hr />

<p class="date">April 17</p>
<p class="title">Reaching for the Stars: A Brief Introduction to Spaceflight</p>
<p class="presenter">Russell Wolf</p>
<p class="abstract">We spend lots of time at Fuertes looking up into space. Ever wonder
how to get there? Launching man-made objects into orbit is an
enormously difficult task, and one of the most difficult engineering
feats ever accomplished. Come learn about some of the rockets that
lift satellites and people into space - including how they work, their
history, and their future.</p>
<hr />

<p class="date">April 24</p>
<p class="title"> Stars: An Inside Story </p>
<p class="presenter">Russell Reinhart</p>
<p class="abstract">Imagine yourself laying outside on a clear night 2,000 years ago, and someone next to you told you the tiny flecks of light you saw were actually balls of gas, larger and hotter than you could comprehend. You, and most everybody else would probably would have dismissed such ideas as nonsense. I will explain the sequence of key events that has led to our current understanding of what the stars are made of, and how they work.</p>
