<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2012</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Transits and Eclipses: Planetary Peekaboos</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">
This is a VERY good year for things getting in front of the Sun. The Moon will twice eclipse the Sun: 1st, on May 20 or 21 (depending where you live) an annular eclipse, visible across the northern Pacific basin, including western North America; then, on Nov. 13 or 14, a total eclipse (northern Australia will be the only landfall). And on June 5 or 6, the planet Venus will pass also in front of the Sun: a transit, also visible across the Pacific (although part of it will be visible from North America)--and the last one until 2117(!). In this talk we will look at the geometry that differentiates the three, the historical importance of transits for determining the size of our solar system, and how they are now used to discover an amazing variety of planets in other star systems. Please join us!

<p class="title">The Death of Stars</p>
<p class="presenter">Bryan Scherrer</p>
<p class="abstract">
Last semester, CAS learned of the full-bodied fury of nuclear fusion, of what it really means to be a star. This semester, we go beyond that, to the ends of a star's lifetime. Some results are boring. The least massive stars may live 100 billion years, but go out with little more than a whimper. In contrast, he most massive stars live a scant million years and die in the most colossally destructive events in the known universe.
Come learn about these two extremes and everything in between, as well as what happens after the death of stars.

<p class="title"> The Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, __REALLY__ Big Picture</p>
<p class="presenter">Art Samplaski</p>
<p class="abstract">
    The scale of distances in astronomy is beyond anything in everyday human experience. Also, since we are quite literally stuck in one spot, how can we possibly determine the distance to nebulae and galaxies? In this talk, we will try to put a personal spin, however inadequate, on the first; and we will also see the variety of methods astronomers have used to get estimates of ever greater distances through the universe.
    If you have ever timed yourself to run 100 meters, or can stop by the Sagan Memorial Planetwalk on the Ithaca Commons and time how long it takes you to walk from the Sun pillar to the Earth pillar, we can plug the numbers into a calculator to show just how long it would take -YOU- to get to various places in the immediate universe! :)
    In any case, whether you want to do some SERIOUS long-distance running yourself or just watch others try, please join us!

<p class="title">Earth's Habitability</p>
<p class="presenter">Michael Hammer</p>
<p class="abstract">
To this day, the Earth is the only place we know in the universe that can definitively support life. Right now, we are looking for other planets that could potentially harbor life, but how hard are they to find? The Earth possesses a unique combination of characteristics that any one planet or moon in the rest of the galaxy might never be able to reproduce exactly, yet it is these characteristics that have helped create the diverse biosphere which defines the planet. While we may never find an exact copy of our home planet, we can study what we know about the Earth as well as the rest of the solar system and apply that knowledge to finding other habitable worlds and redefining what it means for a world to be habitable.
