<h2>A Tale of Two Nebulae</h2>

<p>Yet another contribution from Mike Roman's camera, this time of two planetary 
nebulae. The first, the Ring Nebula, is a Fuertes favorite. The Dumbbell Nebula,  
though just as well known, is fainter and farther to the south, so we tend not 
to look at it as much. The two images on the bottom show an approximation of 
how the nebulae look to the eye.</p>

<p>Planetary nebulae form when Sun-like stars expand into 
<span class="defn">red giants</span>, bloated monstrosities around the size of 
Earth's orbit. Because the force of gravity weakens with distance, the inflated 
star has a very weak grip on its surface layers. All stars blow matter off into 
space, but red giants do so very quickly, and it is this ejected material that 
becomes a planetary nebula as the star whittles itself down to its core. A few 
CAS members have called this process an explosion &mdash; well, sure, if you 
let your explosions take a thousand years! Planetary nebulae vanish almost 
as quickly as they form, expanding and mixing into the interstellar medium 
within a few tens of thousands of years. In contrast, the original star lived 
for billions of years.</p>

<p>The Ring Nebula is around 2300 light years away and 6-8000 years old. The 
Dumbbell is much closer, with a distance of only 420 light years, but the age 
is much less certain, with different techniques giving values from 3000 to 
9000 years old. Both are a bit under a light-year across. Most astronomers 
believe that both nebulae are actually cylindrical. In the Dumbbell we see 
the cylinder from the side, while in the Ring we are looking down one of the 
ends.</p>
