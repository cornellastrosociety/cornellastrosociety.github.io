<h2>CAS Lectures Spring 2008</h2>

<p>The CAS Lecture Series is an opportunity for the general public to learn more 
about astronomy than the weekly observing sessions permit. The series consists of 
several talks given by CAS members or outside speakers on a variety of topics in astronomy 
or space exploration. The lectures are held on Fridays throughout the fall and 
spring semesters at 7:30 PM in the first floor classroom at Fuertes. Little or no 
astronomy background is required. If weather permits, the observatory will be open 
for public viewing after the talk.</p>

<p class="title">Planetary Weather - When Mother Nature Really Doesn't Like You</p>
<p class="presenter">Brian Crandall and Lisa Bacis</p>
<p class="abstract">"It's cold. It's snowy. It's windy. The weather in Ithaca is terrible!" Quit your
complaining. You think winter is bad? Mother Nature has spared you because you haven't seen anything yet.
Try winds faster than a jetliner, with temperatures able to freeze your blood solid or a trip to a place
where it's hot enough to melt lead and a "rain" shower might burn holes through your flesh. Or perhaps
you'd like a taste of both where the daily high is hundreds of degrees warmer than the nighttime low.
Join us for a tour of the weather of the solar system in all of its furious, chaotic glory.</p>
