<h2>Estevan A. Fuertes</h2>

<p>Fuertes Observatory is named after Estevan A. Fuertes, a civil engineer from Puerto 
Rico (born 1838, died 1903). Estevan Fuertes became Dean of the Engineering School 
at Cornell University in 1873. (See The Cornellian, 1888 p 139, an article entitled 
"Estevan A. Fuertes").</p>

<p>From the Cornell Alumni News, p 294:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As the crowning of the course in surveying, Professor Fuertes had built and equipped a <a href="/CAS/history/gs.html">small observatory</a> on the Campus where the Seniors on every 
clear evening throughout the fall term made observations on the stars and computed time, 
latitude, and azimuth. Theory and methods he taught in his course on Practical Astronomy, the 
larger part of which remained a mystery to the class, even to those who managed to pass the course."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From "Otro Ilustre Desconocido: Estevan Antonio Fuertes" by Jos&eacute; L&oacute;pez Baralt. Puerto Rico 
Hustrado, p 12 &amp; 54. Around 1932.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"La astronom&iacute;a fu&eacute; una de sus grandes aficiones, y sus conocimientos astron&oacute;micas 
eran muy profundos. Por muchos a&ntilde;os ense&ntilde;&oacute; dicha materia. El reloj en la 
torre de la biblioteca de Cornell, que divide oficialmente el tiempo para la Universidad por 
muchos a&ntilde;os estuvo dirr_ido con precisi&oacute;n matem&aacute;tica por las observaciones 
peri&oacute;dicas que hacia Fuertes en la b&oacute;veda celeste. Dificilmente se puede pasar 
por Cornell sin leer en los anuncios semanales de las actividades universitarias: "Friday night, 
if clear, public night at the Fuertes Observatory" En los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os de su vida, 
un amigo admirador suyo regal&oacute; a la Universidad un observatorio astron&oacute;mico, que 
perpet&uacute;a el nombre y la memoria del gran puertorrique&ntilde;o."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Translated by Joelle Meniktos-Nolting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Astronomy was one of his great enjoyments, and his astronomical knowledge was very extensive. 
For many years, he taught this subject. The clock in the tower of the Cornell Library which 
officially divides the time for the university for many years was monitored with mathematical precision 
by Fuertes' periodical observations of the sky. Its difficult to walk through Cornell without reading 
in the weekly announcements of the university activities "Friday night, if clear, public night at 
the Fuertes Observatory." In the last years of his life, an admiring friend of his gave the university 
an astronomical observatory that perpetuates the name and the memory of the great Puertorican.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another Fuertes of note, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, was Estevan's son. It is after Louis Agassiz 
Fuertes that the <a href="http://birds.cornell.edu/aboutclo/">Cornell Ornithology Lab</a> is named 
after. This information from Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. 7, p 52-53, from the Rare and 
Manuscript Collections at Cornell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[At the time that Fuertes was dean of the Civil Engineering at Cornell University], Cornell was 
then at low ebb; the engineering department was housed in two rooms over the veterinary department, 
from which nauseating smells continually arose... [Fuertes'] dexterity and precision were extraordinary, 
and for many years he personally made regular star observastions by which the university tower clock 
was accurately controlled." </p>
