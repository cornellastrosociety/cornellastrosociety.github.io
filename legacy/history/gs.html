<h2>The "Goldwin Smith" Observatory</h2>

<h3>From Hewitt. Cornell: A History, 1905, p 342:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Professor Fuertes had advocated for many years the erection of an astronomical observatory. 
He possessed several telescopes which were purchased by the university, and which were installed 
in a wooden building which stood on the site of the north wing of the Goldwin Smith Hall. Later 
it was removed to the site of Stimson Hall. The building had many practical conveniences, owing 
to the skill and enthusiasm of the professor who planned it. It, however, was imcomplete, and was 
itself a standing reproach to the campus."</p>
