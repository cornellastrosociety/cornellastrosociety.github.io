<h3>Monday, August 13, 2007</h3>

<p>Art began with Jupiter for focusing, then tried again for Vesta, picking
up M&nbsp;4 and M&nbsp;80 along
the way. Even though this time it was in front of the dark nebula
B41, without photos for blink
comparison there are just too many stars too faint for the <i>Uranometria</i>
charts to distinguish it. It was somewhere near &psi;-Ophiuchi and the small
bright nebula I.4601, which appears to be associated with several double stars; the
latter is not bad. He compared some multiple
stars in different eyepieces: the double &beta;-Scorpii is nice, but it took the 12mm
in order to resolve all four
components of &nu;-Scorpii. (Chromatic aberration made the two A components,
listed as two white stars, look orange and green(!).) He got Ms&nbsp;9 and 5, the
tiny but cute planetary nebula NGC&nbsp;6210 in Hercules, and finished with
another look at the beautiful cluster IC&nbsp;4665.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 11, 2007</h3>

<p>Brandon again set up his Celestron on the deck while Art worked the 12-inch.
Art went for various (near-)circumpolar targets; he got the open clusters NGC 7790,
Be58, Cz43, and M&nbsp;52; did a very iffy find of NGC 7635, the Bubble Nebula
(open cluster/bright nebula near M&nbsp;52); got NGC 7662 (Blue Snowball), and
found the very faint NGC&nbsp;185, one of two dwarf galaxy satellites of
M&nbsp;31. (The
other, NGC&nbsp;147, was too faint to see.) Brandon did Jupiter and M&nbsp;31 for
calibration/focusing, then got the cute Fairy Ring asterism in Cygnus, M&nbsp;13,
NGC&nbsp;6207 (faint galaxy nearby), NGC&nbsp;278, a confirmatory find of
NGC&nbsp;185, and the open cluster NGC&nbsp;7209. Mike took over from Art
after 11pm, and Brandon left soon thereafter. Mike tried to see various nebulae
comparing views with and without the OIII filter: the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146)
was extremely iffy, but with the filter he got the eastern portion (NGC 6992)
of the Veil--could not see it w/o the filter, and couldn't see the western
portion either way. He also got M39 before going off to Mt. Pleasant.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 4, 2007</h3>

<p>A very clear night with late moonrise provided a relatively remarkable view of
the Milky Way from the Fuertes deck, and a great opportunity to get fainter summer
targets. To this end, no less than three scopes were used: Brandon brought his
Celestron, Mike got a Meade from downstairs storage, and Art manned the house
refractor. Their respective hauls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Art got M&nbsp;4, M&nbsp;80, and Neptune; figured out the secret to finding
Barnard's Star (there are two arcs of three small stars nearby; get the wrong one and
you're lost), and saw the extraordinarily beautiful open cluster IC&nbsp;4665 en
route
to it&mdash;the cluster is so wide one needs to use the finder scope to see it! He also
got Ms&nbsp;8, 20, 24, 17, 18, and 31, plus the Double Cluster, in the binoculars for
three
summer high school students about to leave in the morning for China, and went
down to give a quick sky tour to a group of people on blankets on the Fuertes lawn.
He failed again to find Vesta, however.</li>

<li>Between enjoying many early Perseid meteors, Brandon got NGCs&nbsp;6905
(Blue Flash Nebula), 7331 (Pegasus galaxy), 6910, 6934 (Delphinus open clusters),
6992 (brighest section of the Veil Nebula&mdash;first time in many years it's been
seen at Fuertes!) 6819 (open clus.), 7009 (Saturn Nebula), and 6888 (Crescent Nebula:
"<i>very</i> faint, barely even there, wouldn't know for sure except for a reference
photo"), plus M&nbsp;8, M&nbsp;30, and an iffy find of Uranus. ("My scope's GOTO
computer said it found it, but I don't really believe it.")</li>

<li>Mike got Jupiter, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyrae, and Ms&nbsp;22, 28, 57, 20, 21, 13, 31,
and 15. A major accomplishment re the Meade was getting it completely up to snuff,
calibrated, and the motor working properly. We now have a portable scope available
for any Mt. Pleasant or other excursions.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 3, 2007</h3>

<p>A very hazy and variably cloudy night following an evening/afternoon of
thunderstorms, the distant lightning of which continued to illuminate the sky
throughout the hours. Relatively few guests, numbering no more than 30, enjoyed
Jupiter and Ms&nbsp;3, 57, and 13.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, July 29, 2007</h3>

<p>At a dinner at a professor's house, Mike met "a post-doc guest who studies
Jupiter but had never actually seen it!" He quickly rectified the situation for said
person.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 20, 2007</h3>

<p>A good clear night with no haze for the 38th anniversary of the Apollo 11
landing&mdash;about 100 visitors in a steady stream until 2230, then the place
practically cleared by 2245. The C-14 was set up as the "Jupiter scope" for the early
rush; later, Brandon also got Ms&nbsp;8, 11, and 15 with it. The binoculars were
set on Venus to start; later "planned targets" included the
M&nbsp;8&ndash;M&nbsp;20 pair and Albireo. Since it <i>was</i> the Apollo
anniversary, the main scope was kept on the Moon until 2215 so people could see
the neighborhood of the landing. After that, Art moved to M&nbsp;20 for the public,
glimpsing en route Ms&nbsp;28 and 8, as well as NGC&nbsp;6544 (a
small globular). A very late evening target was the Rocking Horse Cluster, and Art
showed the last dozen folks M&nbsp;31/32. He did M&nbsp;110 for practice after
they left.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 13, 2007</h3>

<p>A fairly cool evening, with about 60-56 visitors, peaking between 10 and 10:30pm.
Art had opened determined to look at things other than Jupiter for once, only to
have clouds come in and hide everything except Venus (and Saturn, now almost
unviewable in the scope due to lowness) for a long time. (Eventually there was
some Saturn viewing...) Mike bowed to pressure to look at Jupiter and
promised to keep it to 20 minutes; Art held him to it, and took over after 26 min.,
since Sagittarius was now in the tree-gap to the SSE. A good crowd got to see the
globular cluster M28, which Art stopped at en route to the Lagoon Nebula (M8),
then the Lagoon itself. (Art also glimsped the small globular NGC 6544 while
moving to the Lagoon but didn't show that to people after the more spectacular
M28.) Also viewed were M13 and the Ring Nebula&mdash;the latter, along with
M56, found by Bernadette in after-hours training. Also in late evening, Mike
located the recently
discovered comet 2006 Linear VZ13 in Draco. Binocular objects earlier in the
evening included &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae and Albireo, and Art showed the last
dozen+ visitors pairs of Sagittarius M-objects in them: M8/20, and M24/18.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, July 12, 2007</h3>

<p>A bit of summer training: Bernadette found M29 while Dounan battled
macroeconomics. Clouds moved in just as Mike arrived, thwarting any subsequent
astronomical pursuits.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 10 2007</h3>

<p>Two groups from CAU (Cornell Adult University) and a science teacher's
retreat originally scheduled for Monday came by;l total of about 40. It was so hazy
that the Summer Triangle could barley be seen!:( Art, and Brian Kent and Ann
Martin of Astro, were only able to get Jupiter and &epsilon;-Lyrae in the
telescope and Venus in the binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 6 2007</h3>

<p>Shianne started with Venus then Saturn; Saturn is now so low that by the
time people were done with Venus, it had turned red. "More than a few people"
were too nervous to stand on top of the ladder to see it (and Shianne was getting
nervous watching them try!) so she switched to the more easily viewed (i.e.,
higher!) Ring Nebula. Brandon had his own 'scope on the deck; heshowed
people Jupiter, M4, and other unlogged targets. The Telrad batteries died while
Shianne was switching targets, which of course involved a large crowd eagerly
waiting for the next object...</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 3, 2007</h3>

<p>Shianne open at the request of a summer RA and showed a group of 20
freshmen Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Fireworks were visible in the horizon.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, July 1, 2007</h3>

<p>Art stopped by briefly for some Canada Day solar viewing: only one small spot
and one tiny prominence.</p>

<p style="font-size: x-small;">Of the two junko chicks, one is gone entirely and
the other was hopping around the deck, not quite able to take off fully.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 29, 2007</h3>

<p>A large noisy crowd (over 150) on a cool summer night, just prior to a full Moon.
Never got off Saturn/Jupiter/Moon all evening.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 25, 2007</h3>

<p>Art brought his adopted parents by. They were troopers enough to climb the
ladder to see the moon. They also saw Venus/Saturn/Jupiter in the binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 23, 2007</h3>

<p>An intended expedition to Mt. Pleasant was foiled by clouds. Art stayed to give
new summer member Chris a chance to practice opening/closing; he got Vega
before the clouds won. Earlier Art used the binoculars to begin studying lunar
geography after being embarassed at not being able to identify some prominent
craters for visitors yesterday evening.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 22, 2007</h3>

<p>It was clear and <span class="superem">cold</span> for June; A light but steady
flow of visitors until about 10:40pm: ca. 45-50 total. First part of the evening was
spent on the usual suspects (moon, Saturn, Jupiter); later telescope objects were
M4 and M28, found by Bernadette. A new interested person was shown how to
find Jupiter after hours. Also post-midnight, Art &amp; Mike began zipping through
Sagittarius/Ophiuchus M-objects in the binoculars: Ms 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 17, 18, 16,
22, and 28. Art continued a bit longer, getting M103, the Rocking Horse Cluster
(NGC&nbsp;6910), M11, and M10 or 12&mdash;not quite sure, clouds were in the
area. Earlier binoculars objects included Albireo, M13 and the season's first look
at M31.</p>

<p style="font-size: x-small;">Note: we have a Fuertes tenant&mdash;a junko
has set up nest in a corner of the deck, with two chicks.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, June 20, 2007</h3>

<p>Cooler, after several sweltering days. Another failed attempt to see the ISS in
the telescope. Art and Mike then tried
to find the asteroid Vesta; might have seen it, but it was in an area of stars too faint
to be on the <i>Uranometria</i> charts. Mike found the Coma galaxy NGC 4631,
then Bernadette found the needle Galaxy (NGC 4565) with help from Art. We showed
Mike's landlord/roommate M11, M13, M4, Jupiter, and the Coma Cluster in the
binoculars. Mike tried to find Barnard's star but failed. Shianne took up the gauntlet
and vowed to find it next time. There were also some very nice shooting stars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 18, 2007</h3>

<p>Art came in to check various targets he'd found in the spring/summer volume
of <span class="title">The Night Sky Observer's Guide</span>. He used the moon
and Saturn (plus 4 moons, three in a tight triangle to one side of the planet) for
focusing while waiting for dark; he then set up yet another attempt to see the Int'l
Space Station, this time with docked shuttle, since it was due to pass within a few
arc seconds of the double star &nu;&nbsp;Draconis as seen from Ithaca. He waited
with the star centered in the 40mm wide-angle, only to see the glow of the ISS
zoom past <span class="superem">just outside</span>the field of view! He was
so disgusted that he closed immediately, taking only long enough to view the
Cat's-Eye Nebula just to say he'd seen <u>something</u>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 15, 2007</h3>

<p>Waves of moderate-sized crowds kept things busy until 12:45am. Telescope
targets were again limited to Venus/Juptier/Staurn and M&nbsp;51. Binocular
objects, apart from the planets, were the Coma Star Cluster, M&nbsp;13, Albireo
(components just resolvable), and &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae (as a simple double
star).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 9, 2007</h3>

<p>Final night of Alumni Reunion. Friday had been rained out, but tonight was Mob
Control Central: over 300 visitors. (Some even showed up before sunset! Fortunately,
Art had arrived about 7:45pm to see whether he could find Mercury in the
daytime&nbsp;he couldn't&nbsp;so he was able to show them Venus and Saturn
while the Sun was still up. Venus was a half-moon but not painfully blinding as it
usually is at night in the telescope, and Saturn looked like a pale impressionist
watercolor.) Art and Brandon set up the Celestron C-14 on the deck in hopes that it
would function as the "Saturn/Jupiter" scope, but even so, the main telescope was still
stuck on Saturn for over half the evening. (Titan and Rhea eventually were visible.)
Once again the targets were limited to Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, M&nbsp;13, and
M&nbsp;57. Art tried for M&nbsp;82 but it clouded over for a bit; he again got the
Whirlpool Galaxy for the last half-dozen visitors. When they left he tried to find the
asteroid Vesta, but there was nothing on the chart to help him distinguish it. He
instead got globular clusters M&nbsp;107 and M&nbsp;4 when Mike, Shianne, and
Dounan arrived <i>Very</i> Fashionably Late&trade;, having gotten lost during a
"day" trip to Cooperstown. Mike stayed for an hour or so, locating globular clusters
NGCs&nbsp;6293, 6284, 6287, 6325 (very faint) and Ms&nbsp;80, 19, 62, 9, 107;
nebulae/OCs Ms&nbsp;17 (Omega), 8 (Lagoon), 20 (Trifid); dark nebula B&nbsp;72
("The Snake", which of course was invisible even through an exposure); and closed
with "a very impressive look" at Jupiter. Particularly with a green filter on, the Red
Spot had never looked so clear before.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, June 7, 2007</h3>

<p>Art opened for the first night of Alumni Reunion. There were somewhere
between 80 and 100 visitors, many of whom voiced gratitude that Fuertes was being
opened for more than just the regular Friday viewing. Mostly Saturn and Jupiter all
night&mdash;what else? Attempts to see M&nbsp;65/66 and &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae
failed, apparently due to haze, but he was able to get M&nbsp;13 and the Ring Nebula
for visitors late in the evening, and 3 people who stuck it out till the end got to see the
Whirlpool/NGC&nbsp;5195&mdash;no spiral structure visible tonight,
however.</p>

<p>N.B.: Art wishes to express gratitude to the CAS alumnus from the early '80s, now
an astronomy professor in Arizona, who was by for a couple of hours and who wound
up giving sky tours to the crowds out on the deck while Art had to stay inside with the
telescope and the people climbing the ladder to look.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, June 6, 2007</h3>

<p>Between 11:15pm and 2:45am Art saw Jupiter + 4 moons for focusing, and then
open clusters Cr&nbsp;394, Ru&nbsp;145, Ms&nbsp;25, 23, 21, 18 (Black Swan), and
NGCs&nbsp;6568, 6596, 6603, and 6716; globular clusters M&nbsp;28 and
NGCs&nbsp;6544 and 6553; emission nebulae M&nbsp;8 (Lagoon), NGCs&nbsp;6589
and 6590; the star cloud M&nbsp;24; OCs/nebulae M&nbsp;20 (Trifid), 17 (Omega), and
16 (Eagle); and the galaxies NGCs&nbsp;4565 (Needle), 4474, 4725, and Ms&nbsp;64
(Black-Eye), 63 (Sunflower), and 51/NGC&nbsp;5195 (Whirlpool). He might have
glimpsed galaxy NGC&nbsp;4712, but it was very iffy, and should have been
impossible if the magnitude listed in the <i>Uranometria Guide</i> was correct. On
the other hand, all the dorm lights on North Campus were out, so for the first time at
Fuertes he was able to see the spiral structure in the Whirlpool (in the 40mm wide
angle eyepiece; it was not visible in a 26mm).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, June 5, 2007</h3>

<p>Seizing the only clearing of the evening, Mike and Dounan stopped by for a look
at Jupiter at opposition. The Galilean satellites were beautifully aligned with perfect
symmetry.</p>

<hr />


<h3>Friday, June 1, 2007</h3>

<p>Skies were nearly overcast; Mike and Brandon wound up giving a modified
"cloudy-night" tour to a few visitors, with the addition of laser-pointing at the few
visible points of light&mdash;namely, Venus, Arcturus, Vega, Polaris, a few Big
Dipper stars, and much of the constellation Hercules. They then proceeded to argue
about the depiction of Hercules for some time, until Shianne, Dounan, Shawn, and
CAS alumna Tanja arrived for an all-too brief look at Jupiter and 3 of its moons, seen
also by a stray group of late-night visitors.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 29, 2007</h3>

<p>Another gorgeous evening caused Mike to come by for a bit, although he restricted
his observing to solar system objects due to the nearly full (and blue) waxing moon.
Seeing was very good, allowing for a rock-steady Saturn and some pleasing views of
the lunar terminator. He experimented with filters on Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and
Jupiter, and enjoyed a fine, short-lived corona around the moon from an apparent
contrail.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 28, 2007</h3>

<p>The combination of clear skies and the calm that is Ithaca the day after graduation
was too tempting a combo for Art. Due to moon pollution, he decided to go mainly for
double stars, but got a few DSOs as well. Saturn and 4-5 moons were used for
focusing&mdash;the Cassini Gap and one cloud belt were distinct. M&nbsp;104 was
very faint; the nearby Struve&nbsp;1669 was an excellent yellow-yellow double.
35&nbsp;Coma Berenices was also a nice double&mdash;supposedly one component
is purple, but he couldn't tell for sure; Burnham&nbsp;800, two orange-reds, was ehhh
by comparison. He also saw M&nbsp;53 and two Coma galaxies, NGC&nbsp;4565, the
Needle Galaxy (allegedly the best edge-on in the Northern Hemisphere) and
NGC&nbsp;4725. Both were distinct although faint due to the moon; to be checked
again when it's darker. He finished up with Jupiter (3 moons, 2 cloud belts, 1 moon
shadow, no spot) for giggles, and closed at 11:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 25, 2007</h3>

<p>In honour of graduation weekend, Shianne decided to open despite thick haze,
clouds, and the potential threats from nearby thunderstorms. While it didn't rain, it
didn't clear, either, so except for a brief stopover at Venus the telescope was on the
moon all evening. Brandon played the <i>Star Wars</i> soundtrack in honor of the
film's 30th anniversary today, and encouraged all to buy the now-available
commemorative stamp set. ("I really don't need stamps now, but maybe later..."
"What?! Don't buy them to <u>use</u> them, buy them to <i><u>frame</u></i>
them!")</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 21, 2007</h3>

<p>For several evenings Krzysztof had been trying to get working the home-kit CCD
camera that CAS had begun building a couple of years ago. By the time he closed down
at 12:30am he figured he had most of the remaining problems ironed out, and had
obtained images of Saturn, &nu;&nbsp;Herculis, and half of M&nbsp;13, plus "way too
much calibration data." He left copious troubleshooting notes for future CCD users.
Art and Mike stopped by briefly in the early evening, and checked out Venus, Mercury
and the moon in binoculars after they couldn't decide whether they were really seeing
Earthshine despite the moon's being fairly illuminated. Turned out they really were
seeing it.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 18, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim and Mike opened; Lisa, Brian, Shianne, Jenn, and Art were also by. There was
a steady flow of visitors all evening, although no crowd rush; the total was about 60.
The telescope was mostly on Venus, the moon, Mercury, and Saturn all evening; the
"industrial" binoculars on the deck were also on the moon, Saturn, and Jupiter (plus
two moons) for much of the evening, although they were also trained on M&nbsp;44,
M&nbsp;13, and the Coma Open Cluster. In late evening, Kim finally got to move the
telescope to M&nbsp;65. We closed about 12:15am.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, May 13, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike, Dounan, Kim, and Shianne came by to search for Comet Lovejoy.
Eventually they were able to find it, and took two pictures 20 minutes apart to show its
relative motion.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 11, 2007</h3>

<p>As too often happens, a sky that was clear when people (in this case, Shianne and
Jennifer) left their dorms to come up to Fuertes had clouded over by the time they
arrived. Deciding on some terpsichorean indulgence, they put on some music only to
have an ever-increasing crowd of people come by, "until there was a whole dome
room full of people wondering why the telescope couldn't see through the clouds." It
cleared long enough to show off a half-moon phase Venus and Saturn briefly.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, May 9, 2007</h3>

<p>Art opened for a special request, but the skies were mostly cloudy. He showed
Venus and Saturn to a grad student and then his friend. Initially Saturn was excellent:
the Cassini Gap was blatantly obvious, and at least one cloud band and five moons
were clearly visible. He closed at 10:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 4, 2007</h3>

<p>A relatively clear and peaceful night on Slope Day allowed teetotalers and
carefully paced drinkers alike an opportunity to admire the heavens. As the waning
gibbous moon rose late in the night, we were able to display galaxies M&nbsp;61 and
M&nbsp;104 in addition to the usual Venus-Saturn planetary combo, while the deck
was kept busy with binocular observations (M&nbsp;44, M&nbsp;13, Moon, Jupiter,
and&mdash;according to some&mdash;M&nbsp;66(!)) and tours of the spring
constellations. As midnight approached, visitors and officers shuffled out, leaving
Mike alone with the clusters M&nbsp;13, M&nbsp;92, NGC&nbsp;6629, and the always
mighty Jupiter.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, May 2, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike stopped in to view Sunspot&nbsp;953 at around 3:00pm. In these quiet
times, Sunspot&nbsp;953 was the first spot in several weeks, though its appearance
was rather typical. Mike came back with Dounan in the evening for a second look, and
left as Art arrived at 8:30pm for some nocturnal observations. He made another try for
starhopping through the Leo-Virgo galaxies, but was foiled by moon
pollution&mdash;when at 10:30pm he could not see M&nbsp;98 or M&nbsp;99, he
gave it up as a lost cause&mdash;only got M&nbsp;105, NGC&nbsp;3384, M&nbsp;96,
M&nbsp;95, M&nbsp;65, M&nbsp;66, and M&nbsp;104.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, April 30, 2007</h3>

<p>Shianne and Kim successfully imaged Castor and Pollux.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, April 29, 2007</h3>

<p>Elise was in a bit of procrastinatory mood, and, with the help of Kim, decided to
stop by to poke around with the binoculars to look at nothing in particular. It was a bit
hazy so only the brighter stars were easily seen. Elise examined the Big Dipper (though
found it kind of difficult as her hands are shaky) and found (although she's sure
someone already knew this) that one of the stars in the Big Dipper is really two (Mizar
and Alcor). As Elise was packing up, Shianne came by to work on imaging. Shianne
tried some more imaging to calibrate the webcam, but just as she finally got the scope
centered enough so that Pollux showed up on the computer screen, it clouded
over.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, April 24, 2007</h3>

<p>Art ran an afternoon solar training session for Kim, Elise, and Dounan with both
the mylar and the hydrogen-&alpha; filters. All were successful, although only 3-4 tiny
prominences and no sunspots were visible.</p>

<p>Art then stayed into the evening in case others came by for training. Since none
did, he practiced star-hopping the Leo/Virgo galaxies, starting from Regulus. Lots of
moonlight made things almost invisible, but he was going steadily until he got lost
after M&nbsp;87. He tried to restart, got a few more, but had to stop at 10:45pm due to
back pain/tiredness. The final object tally was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moon (lots of blur)</li>
<li>Saturn + 4 maybe 5 moons</li>
<li>M&nbsp;105</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;3384</li>
<li>M&nbsp;96</li>
<li>M&nbsp;95</li>
<li>M&nbsp;66</li>
<li>M&nbsp;65</li>
<li>M&nbsp;98 (nearly invisible)</li>
<li>M&nbsp;99</li>
<li>M&nbsp;100</li>
<li>M&nbsp;86</li>
<li>M&nbsp;84</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;4435</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;4438</li>
<li>M&nbsp;87</li>
<li>something else (NGC&nbsp;4476? NGC&nbsp;4478?)</li>
<li>M&nbsp;59</li>
<li>M&nbsp;60</li>
<li>M&nbsp;58</li>
<li>M&nbsp;90</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, April 21, 2007</h3>

<p>Krzysztof held a training session for some new members. They were able to
successfully point the telescope at the moon, Venus, Saturn, Pollux, and
&delta;&nbsp;Geminorum. Unfortunately, technical problems with the telescope
made star-hopping all but impossible.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 20, 2007</h3>

<p>Krzysztof gave a dark matter talk to about 25 people. By the time he finished,
people were already going up to the dome, the beginnings of a crowd of over 150 that
didn't finally end until 12:22am. Both the dome room and the deck were completely
packed for a while. The main telescope switched between Venus, the crescent moon,
and Saturn for nearly all evening, although some visitors also got to see the two
galaxies M&nbsp;65 and M&nbsp;66. Moon observations, especially through the
bino-viewer, were a big hit, but not the biggest: the whole dome-room full of people
cheered when we switched the telescope back to Saturn (we can distinctly picture
Jagadheep's expression of dismay/disgust had he been there).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brandon put up his Celestron on the deck and pointed it at several
targets, including Saturn, M&nbsp;35 (an open star cluster), and the moon.
Unfortunately the telescope got kicked around for a bit and stopped working properly.
Through the binoculars visitors got to see M&nbsp;44 (Beehive Cluster), M&nbsp;35,
and possibly the Perseus Double Cluster.</p>

<p>As soon as public viewing ended Shianne tried imaging Saturn and Jupiter with
our webcam for her Astro 334 final project. The webcam unfortunately was not too
great; Shianne eventually gave up on Saturn and went for Jupiter, but the resolution
was still horrible, and she was only able to make out some faint equatorial bands. She
also tried to image the Blinking Planetary Nebula (NGC&nbsp;6826), but it was far too
faint.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, April 19, 2007</h3>

<p>A mostly clear and seasonable spring night was graced by an evening pairing of
two heavenly beauties: Venus and the crescent moon. After taking a few photographs,
Mike and Dounan showed guests Saturn and M&nbsp;13 (Hercules Cluster), which of
course were an attractive pair as well.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, April 3, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim and Elise came up for the evening to show their friend Catherine the
observatory. They started by taking pictures of the moon with their little camera. They
also saw quite a few deer on the hill and a person taking flash pictures of the deer.
There were intermittent clouds, so Elise found Saturn (to Catherine's delight) but not
too much else. They poked around some constellations with binoculars, finding the
Hyades in Taurus, followed by a sneak peak at the Orion Nebula through the trees. It
was a nice warm night!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, April 2, 2007</h3>

<p>A clear night as the full moon rose allowed Kim, Dounan, and Mike to image
Saturn. Though seeing began wonderfully with a crisp, clean Cassini division,
conditions worsened until they closed at 11:00pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 30, 2007</h3>

<p>Elise, Lisa, and Jimmy gave a lecture about the "Ancient G(r)eeks" before everyone
headed upstairs for viewing. There was quite a crowd at first. Wispy clouds pervaded
for a little bit, but eventually dissipated. People saw a moon dog, which Mike says is
rare, and through the scope we looked at Saturn, the moon, M&nbsp;36 (an open star
cluster), and the Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42).</p>

<hr />

<h3><a id="m72bad"></a>Friday, March 30, 2007, 5:45-6:30am</h3>

<p>Art decided to confirm whether M&nbsp;72 and M&nbsp;73 were indeed
theoretically impossible for a Messier Marathon, and did so to his satisfaction. He saw
a nice Jupiter and 4 moons for focusing purposes, and could get the brighter stars of
M&nbsp;16 (Eagle Nebula). M&nbsp;55 (a globular star cluster) was also invisible, but
likely due to dimness&mdash;it was pretty light by that point. [Art took into account
the fact that the sun would be rising about 27 minutes earlier than the marathon
date.]</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 23, 2007</h3>

<p>Public viewing night: following an undocumented but spectacular sunset, we
opened and were rewarded with a handful of guests who had the privilege of seeing
the moon, Venus, Saturn, the Great Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42), M&nbsp;38,
NGC&nbsp;1907 (two open star clusters), M&nbsp;94 (a spiral galaxy),
and&mdash;after much valiant effort on the part of Brandon, Kim, and
Mike&mdash;M&nbsp;63 (Sunflower Galaxy). The sky was magnificently clear.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, March 20&mdash;Wednesday, March 21, 2007</h3>

<p>Our successful second Messier Marathon attempt is described in great detail on
<a href="messier07.html">its own page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, March 18, 2007</h3>

<p>Our first Messier Marathon attempt.</p>
<p>After a day which was <span class="superem">completely clear</span>, the
clouds began pulling in by 5:00pm. We attempted to do what we could by dialing in,
using the wide-angle 40mm as a faster eyepiece. We used Venus to focus the telescope,
and thought that might be the only object we'd get. In fact we did manage to get
M&nbsp;45 (Art with binoculars, 7:57), M&nbsp;31 (Mike, 8:20) and M&nbsp;32 (Art,
8:24). Kim, Dounan, and Shianne arrived as we gave up the lost cause at 8:45.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 9, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim opened briefly before everyone retired below for Bernadette's talk. The
after-talk observing featured multiple viewings of Saturn, the Christmas Tree Cluster
(NGC&nbsp;2644), the Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42-43), and M&nbsp;66 (a spiral galaxy)
in the 26mm and 40mm eyepieces, as well as many binocular viewings of various
open star clusters (M&nbsp;35, M&nbsp;44, M&nbsp;45, M&nbsp;41, M&nbsp;38,
M&nbsp;36, and M&nbsp;37). Brandon failed in looking for one NGC object, but
finished with the barely visible Whirlpool Galaxy (M&nbsp;51) and its satellite
NGC&nbsp;5195. Though the night was "clear", it was so hazy one could barely see
anything. Only 25-30 visitors showed up tonight. We closed at 11:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, March 7, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim opened the observatory tonight with her brand new key! She was shortly
joined by Art, who stayed long enough to find M&nbsp;50 (an open star cluster) and to
help Kim get Polaris in the scope, but left soon after. Shianne marveled at the double
nature of Polaris, but then retired to the deck with her binoculars and her walkman as
Kim foundthe galaxies M&nbsp;81 and M&nbsp;82 to the delight of Dounan and Jae.
Jae then found Saturn, and they experimented with several different eyepieces,
though found the 13mm most to their liking. Things began to get hazy, and clouds
began to move in in wisps, but not before Kim found NGC&nbsp;2903, a rather faint
galaxy.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 2, 2007</h3>

<p>The night started off well with a wonderful presentation on eclipses by Shianne
and Kim. The first part of the night was excellent for viewing, with mostly clear skies
and moderate late winter temperatures (however, the moon was bright and washed
out some of the sky). The moon and Saturn were popular targets for viewing tonight,
and the belt of Orion was used for practice. In the meanwhile, the remains of the snow
fort were removed from the deck (mostly by shovel, some by snowballs shoved down
members' coats by mischievous folks). Sadly, the night quickly clouded over towards
11:00pm, and snow showers moved into the area, prompting us to close up the
observatory for the night. However, by this time, Shianne, Lisa, and Brian were worn
from their snowball follies, so maybe that was for the best.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, February 24, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike, J.R., Dounan, and some others came to see Venus and Saturn. However,
Mike's storytelling was far more captivating and indescribably funny. They tried
imaging Saturn but failed. Shianne and Kim found the Owl Nebula (M&nbsp;97) and
another object nearby in Ursa Major while Lisa, Mike, and Dounan indulged in a late
supper at Bear Necessities. A guest came by, and they showed him the moon,
M&nbsp;65, and Saturn. They also showed the lone guest the Beehive Cluster
(M&nbsp;44) in binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 23, 2007</h3>

<p>Art arrived at 6:30pm and put the moon in the scope for any early visitors,
although only one&mdash;a friend of Kim&mdash;came by on this sadly short
evening. We found M&nbsp;42-43 (Orion Nebula), the three-part nebula
NGC&nbsp;1973-75-77 above it, and NGC&nbsp;1981 and M&nbsp;41 (two open star
clusters). However, clouds began to swoop in, and we were only able to catch the
moon once more before the clouds overtook the entire sky. As we were walking out,
two more people came by. Art gave them the cloudy sky tour.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, February 21, 2007</h3>

<p>Another miraculously clear night amidst predictions of clouds. This time, we were
able to successfully image Saturn using the laptop of the most gracious and generous
Lisa (despite the lack of instructions). Figuring out how the program works took
longer than expected and the conditions were a little hazy, so the images could use
some definition. We also concluded that the Barlow we used needed some cleaning.
However, averaging the images and processing them should result in a more
satisfactory image... when Mike decides to get around to working on that...</p>

<p>Even if he does procrastinate, we were rather impressed with the electric blue false
color image despite the slightly garish color. We will also try to view the nova in
Scorpius tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Clouds on the horizon obscured the nova.]</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, February 19, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim and Shianne stopped by to take advantage of this unexpectedly clear night.
Clouds crept in after an hour or so, but it was nice while it lasted. Mike dropped in
after a while, but we still couldn't use the webcam to image Saturn because it seems
that he did not simply leave the instructions at home, he actually lost them. The
people who requested that we be open tonight at 10:00 never showed up.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 16, 2007</h3>

<p>This public viewing night featured Saturn, M&nbsp;65, M&nbsp;66 (two spiral
galaxies), and M&nbsp;42 (Orion Nebula).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, February 7, 2007</h3>

<p>Art opened for training at 7:30pm, despite incoming haze. Bernadette arrived and
went to do M&nbsp;1 (Crab Nebula), but was beaten by clouds. They did binocular
training on M&nbsp;41, M&nbsp;47, and M&nbsp;46 (three open star clusters); they
also tried M&nbsp;93 (another cluster) but failed. Bernadette then went for M&nbsp;79
(a globular star cluster); Art meanwhile got M&nbsp;93 in binoculars. Bernadette
found M&nbsp;79 just before clouds shut them down for good.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, February 6, 2007</h3>

<p>Art arrived 6:00pm to indulge in a partial Messier marathon. He looked at Venus
and Mercury in the binoculars; the binoculars also revealed some nebulosity around
M&nbsp;42. The seeing was good early but haze had moved in by 7:30pm. His final
count:</p>
<ul>
<li>M&nbsp;77 was faint but visible.</li>
<li>M&nbsp;33 and M&nbsp;110 were impossible in the 40mm eyepiece.</li>
<li>M&nbsp;41, M&nbsp;44, M&nbsp;45, M&nbsp;35, M&nbsp;36, M&nbsp;37,
M&nbsp;38, M&nbsp;34, M&nbsp;31 all found in binoculars in 2 minutes.</li>
<li>M&nbsp;32 in the telescope.</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;891 could not be found in the telescope.</li>
<li>M&nbsp;34 in the telescope.</li>
<li>Owl Cluster (NGC&nbsp;457)</li>
<li>M&nbsp;52 was uncertain; there were clouds moving in by that time.</li>
<li>M&nbsp;43</li>
<li>NGCs&nbsp;1977-75-73, and M&nbsp;78</li>
<li>M&nbsp;79 was almost invisible through the haze.</li>
</ul>
<p>An Astro person and 3 students came by; Art showed them what was visible. He tried
to do Saturn but several "dead spots" in the dome interfered. While Art was closing,
Kim and Lisa arrived, so he reopened for training. Kim was in process of doing
M&nbsp;47 when clouds overtook it. They tried Saturn again, but found that the
telescope would not lock in either axis, and was almost impossible to focus. The three
together finally got it focused and saw the planet. They closed at 11:10pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, January 17, 2007</h3>

<p>Art did an unofficial opening and training session, but no one came, so he got to
practice. His telescope targets included:</p>
<ul>
<li>M&nbsp;36 (open star cluster)</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;1931 (an emission and reflection nebula; definitely seeable but faint,
probably needs best seeing)</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;1907 (small, tight open cluster just south of M&nbsp;38&mdash;a bit
faint but cute, better in the 18mm eyepiece than the 13.8mm or 26mm)</li>
<li>M&nbsp;38</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;1857 (open cluster)</li>
<li>Cz&nbsp;20 (open cluster&mdash;too diffuse to be of interest)</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;1893 (open cluster&mdash;very loose, uninteresting in 26mm
eyepiece)</li>
<li>Crab Nebula (basically invisible in the 26mm, <em>very</em> faint
but distinct in the 40mm&mdash;we had <em>not</em> seen it on the 16th)</li>
<li>NGC&nbsp;2129 (nice little open cluster in 40mm)</li>
<li>M&nbsp;35 (magnificent in the 40mm)</li>
<li>IC&nbsp;2157 (open cluster&mdash;faint, detached in the 40mm)</li>
<li>Eskimo Nebula (NGC&nbsp;2392, very bright and small in the 40mm eyepiece;
still bright in the 26mm and 18mm, but no structure)</li>
<li>&delta;&nbsp;Geminorum (double star, but couldn't separate components)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike arrived and also did M&nbsp;1 and NGC&nbsp;2129. Meanwhile, Art did the
Pleiades (barely visible due to ice haze) in binoculars, followed by M&nbsp;42-43 in
both binoculars and telescope (there was lots of structure visible in binoculars; the
view was incredible in the 40mm eyepiece). Shianne arrived, so Art tried dialing in
M&nbsp;110 (satellite of Andromeda Galaxy) and M&nbsp;33 (Triangulum Galaxy) as
last practice&mdash;he got M&nbsp;31 (Andromeda Galaxy) and M&nbsp;32 (another
of its satellites) in the 40mm, but couldn't find either M&nbsp;110 or M&nbsp;33
through the ice haze. Art left at 9:40, leaving the observatory to Mike and
Shianne.</p>

<p>The very cold and moonless night allowed for some faint galaxy hunting for Mike;
he spotted NGC&nbsp;2672, NGC&nbsp;2903, NGC&nbsp;2683 (the later 2 being
particularly nice) and wasn't quite convinced he saw NGC&nbsp;2768. The night
ended with a look at Saturn, but not before Shianne found the tiny NGC&nbsp;3156
galaxy.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, January 16, 2007</h3>

<p>After an irritating two weeks of not being able to see Comet McNaught, the sky
seemed to clear tonight, only to keep clouding. Art and Mike spent an hour trying to
get M&nbsp;1; they thought they got it when the clouds interfered again. They closed
just after 9:00pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, January 2, 2007</h3>

<p>Art arrived at 5:45pm for more early-evening Messier marathon practice before
the moon pollution got too much. He got M&nbsp;77, M&nbsp;15, and
NGC&nbsp;7331, but spent too much time trying to figure out how to view
M&nbsp;32 and M&nbsp;110 when they were at the zenith. He closed at 7:45pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, December 24, 2006</h3>

<p>Since it was clear, and several families on Wednesday had been grateful for the
early opening, Art arrived at 6:00pm and did an official opening although he didn't
expect anyone on Xmas Eve. Because no one came, he practiced some near polar and
near zenith items. He successfully got the Owl Cluster (also the E.T.&nbsp;Cluster,
NGC&nbsp;457), NGC&nbsp;1502 (an open star cluster), and Polaris, but failed to find
NGC&nbsp;188 (another open cluster), and IC&nbsp;342 (a galaxy). Art then did
&gamma;&nbsp;Persei, an excellent yellow-orange and blue double star as good as the
more frequently observed &gamma;&nbsp;Andromedae ("Coincidence? I think so!").
He also saw the galaxy NGC&nbsp;891 (<em>very</em> faint), M&nbsp;34 (an open
cluster), and M&nbsp;76 (Little Dumbbell Nebula, easily visible). He failed to get
M&nbsp;33 (Triangulum Galaxy) even in the 40mm eyepiece. He was about to try
M&nbsp;1 (Crab Nebula) when the dome motor died due to a blown fuse, so closed at
8:50pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, December 20, 2006</h3>

<p>We held a special viewing night from 7:00 to 10:00pm to commemorate the tenth
anniversary of Carl Sagan's death. Art arrived at 6:00. Some clouds came at about the
same time, blocking parts of the sky until 8:45. The clearing lasted until 10:15, when we
closed. 20-25 people showed up in total, and got to see M&nbsp;51 (Whirlpool Galaxy),
M&nbsp;38 (an open star cluster), and M&nbsp;42 (Orion Nebula; there was
<em>lots</em> of filament structure visible tonight!) through the main telescope.
The binoculars, meanwhile, were trained on M&nbsp;31 (Andromeda Galaxy),
M&nbsp;45 (Pleiades), and the Perseus Double Cluster. The families who came by with
small children were grateful for the earlier opening time, which did not interfere with
bed times.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, the clouds gave way again to clear, moonless skies. Mike and
Dounan attempted to image Saturn but failed to find a Barlow lens. Defeated and tired,
they instead looked at M&nbsp;104, the Sombrero Galaxy.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, December 19, 2006</h3>

<p>Art came to practice some of the fainter Messier objects, but only got to see
NGC&nbsp;253 (Silver Coin Galaxy, a.k.a. the Sculptor Filament) before getting foiled
by clouds.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, December 14, 2006</h3>

<p>There was a faint green aurora early in the evening low above the northern
horizon, partially obscured by mid- and high-level clouds. The observatory was
opened after midnight for a Resident Advisor who wished to show his residents
Saturn.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, December 13, 2006</h3>

<p>Art arrived at 5:30pm to do the "early evening Messier objects" he had intended to
practice on Tuesday. He got M&nbsp;27, M&nbsp;71, and NGC&nbsp;253 (faint). It was
too hazy for M&nbsp;77's faintness. Two visitors stopped in, and Art showed them the
usual suspects for binoculars: M&nbsp;31 (Andromeda Galaxy), M&nbsp;45 (Pleiades),
M&nbsp;36 through M&nbsp;38 (three open star clusters), and the Double Cluster. He
also did M&nbsp;38 and &gamma;&nbsp;Andromedae (colorful double star) in the
main scope. Art then looked at M&nbsp;31 and its satellite galaxies M&nbsp;32 and
M&nbsp;110, comparing them in the 26mm and 40mm eyepieces.</p>

<p>Shianne and Kim arrived between 7:30 and 8:00 and took over. At Art's parting
suggestion, Kim found M&nbsp;31, M&nbsp;32, and M&nbsp;110 again, though was
surprised in the midst of locating M&nbsp;110 by Jagadheep's furtive arrival. Shianne,
meanwhile, was meteor-watching. Shianne then found the Great Orion Nebula
(M&nbsp;42) for a group of guests as Kim and Jagadheep enjoyed more of the Geminid
Meteor Shower. Just for fun, Shianne found several open clusters in Monoceros
(M&nbsp;47 and Caroline's Cluster, NGC&nbsp;2360) and Kim decided to find
NGC&nbsp;981, a galaxy in Andromeda, on a spontaneous whim. It took some time
before everyone (Dounan had arrived) agreed that they all had seen NGC&nbsp;981 in
the same place in the scope's field of view, but they came to the consensus that it is
indeed visible.</p>

<p>After that, they abandoned looking for objects in the telescope and instead spent
the remainder on the deck watching meteors fall and philosophically analyzing and
debating economic systems with the aid of Dounan's fancy laser pointer. Dounan also
used the laser-pointer to teach some physics by drawing on the stars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, December 12, 2006</h3>

<p>Shianne's altruism is truly admirable: thanks to her, Kim was able to enjoy
another (rather quiet) night at the observatory in spite of the spotty weather. Thin
sheets of clouds rolled in and out for the beginning of the night, making constellation
identification difficult. However, there was a brief period of cloud-free sky in the east,
during which Kim found the open cluster M&nbsp;36, but she got too excited with
switching eyepieces and squandered her clear-sky time on an only moderately exciting
open cluster. Then the really heavy clouds came in, obscuring everything very
thoroughly, and they had to close.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, December 10, 2006, evening</h3>

<p>Shianne was kind enough to open the observatory at Kim's request despite a
rather large philosophy paper. Kim began with the Blinking Planetary Nebula
(NGC&nbsp;6826), and then attempted to find the Bubble Nebula (NGC&nbsp;7635)
but settled for the open cluster M&nbsp;52 when the Bubble could not be seen. Lisa
then found the galaxies M&nbsp;81 and M&nbsp;82 as a few guests came by, and then
Kim went for the reflection nebula M&nbsp;78 in Orion ("a nebulous object for a
nebulous mood"). Mike found the Great Orion Nebula, and Kim tried to find
M&nbsp;79 (a globular star cluster), but the skies clouded up and we closed. The
evening's sights also featured a large bright meteor that was seen going south to east
near Orion, Monoceros, and Gemini.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, December 10, 2006, afternoon</h3>

<p>Art stopped by at 2:30 to take a look at the Sun. The view was disappointing, with
only one sunspot and no prominences. He spent three times as long opening and
closing the observatory as he spent looking through the telescope.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, December 7, 2006</h3>

<p>Dounan Hu, a former CAS member, returned for a visit to Fuertes. The weather
was cloudy, but still clear enough to see bits and pieces of sky. He only saw the Orion
Nebula (M&nbsp;42).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, November 26, 2006</h3>

<p>A relatively warm, moonless night with variable high cloud cover and periods of
excellent seeing. Feeling restless, Mike opened after midnight and had a fine time
imaging M&nbsp;42 and Saturn.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 24, 2006</h3>

<p>Art arrived at 6:00pm and used the Moon to check the adjustable barrel on the
40mm wide-angle. He
then looked for some possible Messier marathon objects: he could find M&nbsp;30
and M&nbsp;77, but NGC&nbsp;253 was barely visible due to haze and he couldn't
decide if he saw M&nbsp;74. When visitors arrived he pointed the telescope at the
Perseus Double Cluster, then at M&nbsp;36 (another open star cluster). Shianne did
the Blinking Planetary Nebula (NGC&nbsp;6826), followed by M&nbsp;15 (a globular
star cluster), the Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42), M&nbsp;77 (a spiral galaxy), and the
Eskimo Nebula (NGC&nbsp;2392).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, November 23, 2006</h3>

<p>After a delicious Thanksgiving meal of Jagadheep's special rice dish, Jennifer's
crescent rolls, and Shianne's Nutty Bars, we enjoyed a night of observing. Jenn found
the Orion Nebula and Castor (a six-star system, though only two of the stars were
visible). Shianne found NGC&nbsp;2244 (an open star cluster). Jenn (with assistance
from Jagadheep) found NGC&nbsp;2141, a very faint open cluster. Mike arrived
during the all too long time Jenn was agonizing over 2141, and proceeded to set up his
camera.</p>

<p>Mike took advantage of the excellent conditions to make some challenging
observations. He saw IC&nbsp;2165 (a planetary nebula), NGC&nbsp;2419 (a globular
cluster that may be a possible "Intergalactic Wanderer"), NGC&nbsp;2339 (a spiral
galaxy), and NGC&nbsp;2832 (a pair of colliding galaxies). He was also able to convince
himself of seeing the Thor's Helmet Nebula (NGC&nbsp;2359) and the Bear's Paw
Galaxy (NGC&nbsp;2537). He ended the night with a look at the Owl Nebula
(M&nbsp;97) and Saturn.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, November 22, 2006</h3>

<p>Thanksgiving break began with an evening of thankfully clear skies. Shianne
(who opened at 8:00) took one hour to get near the planetary nebula PK104-29.1 before
Jagadheep (who arrived 9:00) asked her to check the brightness of the nebula in the
deep sky catalog and found it to be WELL out of reach of the telescope. Shianne instead
found the Blue Snowball planetary nebula (NGC&nbsp;7662), followed by the open
cluster NGC&nbsp;1513. Jagadheep found the rich open cluster NGC&nbsp;1245.
Shianne then found the Eskimo Nebula (NGC&nbsp;2392). Mike, who had arrived by
this time, found the reflection nebula M&nbsp;78. They then spent some time near
the Horsehead Nebula; although they could see wisps of nebulosity in the vicinity,
they could not see the Horsehead. They closed down at about 1:00am.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, November 21, 2006</h3>

<p>We opened tonight for two groups, one from the International Living Center and
one from Alice Cook House. The weather cooperated beautifully! We found
M&nbsp;57 (Ring Nebula), M&nbsp;15 (a globular star cluster), NGC&nbsp;7331 (a
spiral galaxy), M&nbsp;1 (Crab Nebula), NGC&nbsp;663, and M&nbsp;38 (two open
star clusters). Art managed to sneak in a few extra targets before the visitors came,
including the Fairy Ring asterism in the 40mm wide-angle, the open clusters
NGC&nbsp;6871 and Bi&nbsp;1, and a comparison of Uranus in the wide-angle and
26mm eyepieces.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 10, 2006</h3>

<p>Tonight's observing session featured the Blinking Planetary Nebula
(NGC&nbsp;6826), M&nbsp;38 (an open star cluster), a galaxy, M&nbsp;1 (Crab
Nebula), M&nbsp;37, M&nbsp;35 (two more open clusters), Sirius (a practice target for
Lisa), the Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42), and NGC&nbsp;2244 (open cluster). After
midnight, Shianne and Jennifer put out some speakers for a dance party; they even got
some of the remaining guests to start dancing!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 3, 2006</h3>

<p>Tonight, Fuertes featured lecturer Adam Kolozzetti on black holes. He delivered a
highly informed and interesting talk to a room chock-full of eager pupils avidly
soaking up the imparted wisdom. Even Jagadheep jumped into the discussion! We
presented comet SWAN again, though it was faint tonight. Other targets included
&epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae, M&nbsp;52 (an open star cluster in Cassiopeia), Polaris, the
Great Orion Nebula (M&nbsp;42), and finally the Eskimo Nebula (NGC&nbsp;2392) to
many awed visitors. It was a very happy night.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, October 30, 2006</h3>

<p>A training night. Art started by trying to see the International Space Station fly past
&gamma;&nbsp;Ursae Majoris but failed; he then tried various circumpolar objects
and figured out how to see Polaris. Art then did M&nbsp;103 (an open star cluster), the
Owl Cluster (NGC&nbsp;457), the Perseus Double Cluster (he could barely get both
cores in the 40mm wide-angle eyepiece, but it looked <em>GREAT</em>!),
Tr&nbsp;2 (another open cluster), and the double star Struve&nbsp;390 to see whether
the faint component really is purple&mdash;hard to say. Art did Comet SWAN; Mike
then arrived and took some pictures.</p>

<p>At that point Bernadette arrived and found M&nbsp;38 (open cluster). She also
tried to get the Pleiades in the wide-angle, but they were too big even for it. Kim, Lisa,
Peter, and Gregory arrived; the latter two did their first training finds of Vega. Lisa
found &gamma;&nbsp;Andromedae. Most people left, but Art and Kim stayed; she
found M&nbsp;38, then they closed at 11:05.</p>

<p>Mike returned after midnight to attempt a systematic mosaic of the Orion Nebula,
which proved to be a constant struggle with battery life. It began to cloud up around
4:00, before the last sections of the nebula could be photographed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 29, 2006</h3>

<p>A late-evening clearing provided Mike with a splendid night of observing; with
the full moon only about a week ahead and a desire to forget about the Earth as he
knew it, Mike decided to pull an all-nighter here at Fuertes. An otherwise satisfying
and peaceful night was spoiled when he accidentally knocked his camera to the
ground, jamming the lens; resisting the urge to begin crying like a little girl, he was
fortunately able to 'jam' it back, and it now seems to work fine. Mike began the night
with the Saturn Nebula (NGC&nbsp;7009), followed by NGC&nbsp;7789 (an open star
cluster), the Pleiades, M&nbsp;1 (Crab Nebula), M&nbsp;77 (a spiral galaxy),
M&nbsp;78 (a reflection nebula), the Great Orion Nebula (of which Mike took his best
astrophotos yet), M&nbsp;79 (a globular star cluster), and ended with a long, admiring
gaze at Saturn itself, for which no nebula can substitute (sorry, NGC&nbsp;7009), as
twilight began.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, October 26, 2006</h3>

<p>Art and Mike came to see comet SWAN, which was in the middle of an outburst.
Skies were overcast, but waiting was eventually rewarded as a wind shift cleared skies
around 8:30pm. The nucleus was much fainter than on the 13th (it was visible to the
naked eye, perhaps magnitude 4.5?); the tail was very faint but discernible. Art and
Mike were able to get both the comet and the Hercules Cluster (M&nbsp;13) in one
binocular field. After Mike took several pictures they shifted to Neptune and Uranus
as the sky was clear there.</p>

<p>After Neptune, Art decided to go for M&nbsp;72 (a globular star cluster) since he
was in the neighborhood. Out of persnicketyness, he went for the Saturn Nebula
(NGC&nbsp;7009) and found it to be a Splendid Little Object and not at all the invisible
thing malicious rumor had said&mdash;M&nbsp;72 was in fact the pointless and
nearly invisible object! M&nbsp;73 (an open star cluster) was also poor, but M&nbsp;30
turned out to be pretty good.</p>

<p>As Art and Mike were doing log entries, Shianne and a gentleman caller arrived
and reopened. However, they saw nothing, as they were too busy arguing (discussing?)
politics and realized that clouds had moved in by the time they finally came to their
senses!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 13, 2006</h3>

<p>It looked as though <em>again</em> clouds were going to move in at sunset, but
instead we got gradually clearing, if hazy, weather. 40-45 visitors dropped by, and we
showed them Comet SWAN, followed by Uranus. We tried to get to Neptune, but
failed, so instead we looked at M&nbsp;57 (Ring Nebula). We later viewed M&nbsp;31
(Andromeda Galaxy) and M&nbsp;32 (one of its satellites) in the 40mm wide angle
eyepiece. Meanwhile, we trained the binoculars on NGC&nbsp;663 (an open star
cluster), M&nbsp;31, the Pleiades, the Perseus Double Cluster, and
&epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae (quadruple star).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, October 9, 2006</h3>

<p>This night's observing included M&nbsp;13, the Ring Nebula, M&nbsp;15, galaxy
NGC&nbsp;7331, open clusters M&nbsp;36, M&nbsp;37, M&nbsp;38, M&nbsp;35,
NGC&nbsp;1907, and M&nbsp;42 (Orion Nebula). The CAS members who eventually
closed down for the night were astonished to see the street and Appel lights turn off,
and spent a few more minutes admiring the darkness.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 8, 2006</h3>

<p>We took advantage of the unprecedented string of clear nights by having yet
another training session. Targets included M&nbsp;57, Albireo, and
&epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 8, 2006</h3>

<p>Art dropped by to do some quick solar observing. No sunspots were visible, but
Art's efforts were richly rewarded by multiple prominences: four good mid-sized ones,
one "excellent long wispy one", and one "amazingly spectacular" prominence with
intricate structure. The last occupied 10 percent of the 26mm eyepiece's field of view
[so the eruption was 4-5 times the diameter of the Earth]. Art felt so compelled to share
the view that he ended up staying for 90 minutes. Six people who had been strolling
by accepted his invitation, including a couple who'd been at Cornell for 50 years
without visiting Fuertes!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, October 7, 2006</h3>

<p>A training night: targets included Altair, M&nbsp;13 (Hercules Cluster), the
Blinking Planetary Nebula (NGC&nbsp;6826), and &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae (quadruple
star).</p>

<p>Shianne and Mike stayed late and found M&nbsp;57 (Ring Nebula), M&nbsp;96 (a
spiral galaxy), and M&nbsp;1 (Crab Nebula). Mike photographed the moon while
Shianne huddled under a blanket eating cookies.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 6, 2006</h3>

<p>The Harvest Moon washed out everything, but we got a large crowd despite it
being Fall Break&mdash;well over 100, maybe over 150 visitors. We spent several
hours with the telescope pointed at the Moon and the binoculars at M&nbsp;31. Other
targets included M&nbsp;13 (Hercules Cluster), M&nbsp;57, &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae
(atmospheric blurring made the two pairs look like single stars), Albireo, and
&gamma;&nbsp;Andromedae (two colorful double stars). By 11:00pm moonlight
made the Perseus Double Cluster invisible in binoculars; the Pleiades were barely
discernible. We closed at midnight, but Shianne stayed behind to admire
NGC&nbsp;6826 (Blinking Planetary Nebula), M&nbsp;29, and M&nbsp;39 (two
open star  clusters).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 29, 2006</h3>

<p>After Kim gave a talk on the James Webb Space Telescope we tried to observe,
but the clouds were very teasing. We briefly saw the Moon, then shut down because
it was overcast, then reopened. We saw Albireo and quickly shut down again as it
started to rain. Some new members were walked through the shut-down procedure,
by the end of which it was clear again, so Art had them do the opening procedure as
well. They saw &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae (quadruple star) and M&nbsp;57 (Ring Nebula);
about 25-30 visitors in the late evening got to see M&nbsp;31 (Andromeda Galaxy),
and the Perseus Double Cluster in binoculars. Clouds shut us down for good at
11:30pm.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, September 26, 2006</h3>

<p>Art arrived at 7:30pm to check some objects from a list obtained at the Black Forest
Star Party. Mike was there showing a friend things; after showing her M&nbsp;13
(Hercules Cluster), M&nbsp;57, and &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae they left. Art continued,
finding only NGC&nbsp;6210 (Turtle Nebula) and the "Fairy Ring" asterism [small
pattern of stars] in Cygnus before an Astro 101 student and two other visitors
came by. Art showed them M&nbsp;13 and NGC&nbsp;7331 (a spiral galaxy) in the
scope, as well as the Coathanger asterism, M&nbsp;31, and the Double Cluster in
binoculars. The group was also quite startled by two Iridium flares moving in
tandem, so slowly as to seem stationary at first, but brighter than magnitude -4
("we got a supernova???"). When they left, Art checked out M&nbsp;31 and its
"suburbs" (the galaxies M&nbsp;32 and M&nbsp;110) in the 40mm wide angle, then
found the nearby galaxy M&nbsp;33 (finally!) in it. Art's attempt to find the galaxy
NGC&nbsp;247 failed&mdash;it was too faint. He was going for NGC&nbsp;253
(Silver Coin Galaxy) when Mike and B&#x142;a&#x17c;ej came in to try the CCD.</p>

<p>Mike and B&#x142;a&#x17c;ej returned after seeing <span class="title">The Spirit
of the Beehive</span>, determined to finally do some imaging with the <a
href="ccd.html">CCD camera</a>. With B&#x142;a&#x17c;ej's computer know-how
and Mike's telescope skills, they finally created a deep sky image&mdash;a rough
photo of M&nbsp;57. Then Mike stayed way too long taking photos with his Canon of
NGC&nbsp;253 and the Great Orion Nebula. Overall it was a beautifully clear night,
<em>none</em> of which was wasted.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, September 21, 2006</h3>

<p>A clear, crisp, moonless night allowed Kim and Lisa to do some training, and
allowed everyone a glimpse of the photogenic Silver Coin Galaxy
(NGC&nbsp;253).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 16, 2006</h3>

<p>Our first training night! The new members found Altair, star-hopped from Vega
to &epsilon;&nbsp;Lyrae (a quadruple star system), and found M&nbsp;13. There were
some non-training observations, too: Jagadheep found Uranus and Mike found
Neptune. Brandon set up his GoTo Celestron scope on the deck and pointed it at
M&nbsp;13 (Hercules Cluster), M&nbsp;92, M&nbsp;2, M&nbsp;30 (three globular
clusters), M&nbsp;76 (Little Dumbbell Nebula), NGC&nbsp;884 (one of the members of
the Perseus Double Cluster), and many other objects.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, September 11, 2006</h3>

<p>Mike arrived as the Astro 101 lab TAs and Jagadheep (not a TA) were leaving.
Mike spent the night attempting more astrophotography, choosing the subjects
M&nbsp;27 (Dumbbell Nebula) and M&nbsp;57 (Ring Nebula) and applying a more
systematic approach.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, September 10, 2006</h3>

<p>Art came by to check whether Neptune or the asteroid Ceres would be observable
after the upcoming lecture; Mike arrived independently to do astrophotos. The
starfield had too many faint things not on the charts to tell which was Ceres; Neptune
was much easier to find. Two Astro 101 kids and two friends were walking by, so Art
and Mike let them up to do their homework. They also showed them M&nbsp;54 (a
globular cluster picked up during the hunt for Ceres), as well as M&nbsp;13 (Hercules
Cluster) and M&nbsp;31 (Andromeda Galaxy) through the binoculars. Art left at
10:20pm. Mike left at the same time but returned after 1:00am for lunar photography
until clouds moved in around 3:00.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 9, 2006</h3>

<p>The weather in mid afternoon was so different from the National Weather
Service's forecast (sunny with scattered clouds instead of overcast with rain and
thunder) that Art swung by to do a little solar observing. Only one good sunspot and
two tiny ones were visible; there were a couple of small prominences with little
visible structure in a 26mm eyepiece, and one good pair on the northeast limb with
lots of filaments. Art tried looking at the latter with the 9mm eyepiece, but was
disappointed as atmospheric turbulence and the reduced lighting made it impossible
to see the prominence. By the time Art closed and did the log entry (4:40pm), the sky
was much more like the forecast (although with no rain yet).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 8, 2006</h3>

<p>Observations for our first public viewing night of the year started with the
Rocking Horse Cluster (NGC&nbsp;6910), followed by a peek at Jupiter for the new
members. Huge crowds showed up&mdash;well over 100, though we lost count very
early. Alas, Shianne's powers of weather control failed&mdash;it clouded up quite
severely, and heavy haze kept us from seeing much through the holes (we couldn't
even see the Big Dipper!). Searchlights from a frat party [ed.: or some other event] and
a moon one day past full only worsened the conditions. It finally cleared up around
10:00pm, after most of our visitors had left. For those that remained we managed to
look at the Ring Nebula (M&nbsp;57), though lingering haze made it nearly invisible.
After that, Mike put on the binocular eyepiece for Moon-viewing. Our final target was
Uranus; we looked at it through both the 26mm and 9mm eyepieces for comparison.
Art left Mike intending to do astrophotography and Bernadette and Shianne getting
some practice.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, September 7, 2006</h3>

<p>For the first time in over a fortnight, skies were almost clear enough for
astronomical observations, but a thin layer of cirrostratus and a full moon did not
allow for much to be seen, aside from the moon itself. The Astro 103 class held its star
party tonight, and Mike decided to stick around for a bit and help out. Despite
conditions, the party went well and most people seemed to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>Mike left the party early to catch a film and returned with the goal of finding a way
to use the bino-viewers, which had seemed almost unusable because they were too
long to bring into focus. By changing the barrel mount he was able to operate the bino
viewers properly and was rewarded with a pleasant two-eyed view of the moon. He
then proceeded to photograph the moon and, using 15 separate images, created a nice
composite of the entire disk, though it
<!--

literally took all night to do so.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, August 21, 2006</h3>

<p>Art opened for a little practice and because someone from the astronomy
department wanted to bring two visiting students by. They observed the Rocking
Horse
Cluster (NGC&nbsp;6910) and the Owl/ET/Dragonfly Cluster (NGC&nbsp;457) in the
40mm wide-angle eyepiece. Art tried to see how hard it was to point the telescope at
Polaris and unfortunately succeeded. Incoming clouds cut the observing session short;
he tried to show the Hercules Cluster (M&nbsp;13) but it was barely visible through
the haze.</p>
