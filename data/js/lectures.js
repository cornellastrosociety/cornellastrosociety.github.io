Adding a lecture:

Add a corresponding object. Fields include:
 * id: an optional tag to associate an id with the lecture
 * attributes: an object with fields with a (type, value) pair.
   Tags may be used as frequently as desired, except for title
   or specialtitle, of which only one may be used. Types include:
   * title
   * specialtitle (highlights title)
   * date
   * datetime (separate date and time with %)
   * loc
   * presenter
 * desc: Lecture description
 * media: an object with the following fields:
   * type: photo | video | lphoto
   * ref: /data/img/lecture/[].jpg name if photo
          thumb id separated by %%% to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[] if video
          photo id separated by %%% to external link if lphoto
   * attr: Attribution caption, if necessary
   * unbounded: true to override 16:9 aspect ratio

Make sure to escape characters that would break the object format,
such as an apostrophe inside single quotes, with a backslash.

All text fields support HTML input as needed.

If adding a lecture series, update the quick list of upcoming lectures
on the lectures page.

If migrating lectures from cur_lecs to past_lecs, one should also
ensure the date range in the "Past Lectures" block on the lectures
page shows the correct ending year.

But in 1608, the greatest invention of all time was demonstrated for the first time, allowing the blinds to be thrown open and our understanding of who, what and where we are in our existence to be illuminated.

Hastings personally made a 9.4-inch objective for the Johns Hopkins University and published its complete specifications in 1882; the Church objective may have been a direct scale-up of the latter lens with minor adjustments. The talk will include a historical discussion of lens designing and evaluation methods, using two Hastings-designed objectives as examples.',

Further more, this number is expected to rise exponentially over the next few years with new and improved ground- and space-based telescopes set to take center-stage. Recent advances on this front suggest that small, Earth-sized, planets are abundant in our galaxy with many thought to lie in the host star\'s habitable zone where the conditions on the planet are optimal to have liquid water on the surface. This realization, coupled with the ongoing discovery of new organisms on Earth in environments previously thought to be inhospitable for life, suggests that extraterrestrial life could be far more commonplace than previously imagined. In this talk, Dr. Hegde will explore some of the methods that can be used in characterizing an Earth-like planet for potential habitability and life by providing a link between geomicrobiology and observational astronomy.',

To find out if these habitable worlds are inhabited, we need to know the global effects life can have on a planet, and crucially, which of those effects we could observe with our telescopes. We can gain some clues by looking at what life on Earth does today, but, so far, the planets we have found seem to have dramatically different environments compared to the modern day Earth. However, if we look millions, or even billions of years back through time, we start to find overlaps between conditions on these worlds and our own. The further back in time we look, the more alien our planet becomes. Strange environments, climates and weird forms of ancient life serve as perfect tools for figuring out many more of the unique “fingerprints” biology can leave behind on a planet for us to find. All of this takes us a step closer to finding extraterrestrial life – if it is there – on the un-Earth-like worlds around our nearest stars.

Here, I argue that the Earth-centered approach can be causing us to overlook many potentially habitable planets on our target list. Not only can habitable worlds exist during other phases of stellar evolution, but other greenhouse gases, such as hydrogen, can significantly extend the width of the traditional habitable zone. I also discuss the potential habitability of Proxima Centauri b and the TRAPPIST-1 planets within the context of my new habitable zone definitions.',

Some of the most exciting findings have been the discovery of several rocky, "Earth-like" planets in the Habitable ("Goldilocks") Zones of their parent stars (i.e. ability for liquid water to exist on the surface). On November 4th in the Fuertes Observatory Classroom, Dr. Ramirez from Cornell\'s Carl Sagan Institute will discuss many of the intriguing planets found in the Habitable Zone, how they are being studied, and the prospect of possibly finding alien life on a planet light years away from the Earth.',

Probably somewhere with a warm water ocean. It turns out that Earth is not the only such place. There\'s Europa, Jupiter\'s icy moon that has more than double Earth\'s water. This talk will describe NASA\'s plans for a robotic Europa mission, which will conduct detailed reconnaissance during a number of close flybys in the 2020s to determine whether or not the conditions there are suitable for life as we understand it. It will use ice-penetrating radar and magnetometers to understand the depth and salinity of the ocean. And it will look at the heat signatures from plumes erupting from the surface, if they can be found. We\'ll also talk about some more speculative mission concepts, some of which are being developed at Cornell: among them, a soft robotic rover that could slither through the ice and jet around underwater like a squid, and a soda-bottle-size spacecraft carrying aluminum nanoparticles that would explosively react with ice and water on impact, creating a plume to be analyzed by a satellite overhead.',

During the course of their lifetimes, galaxies in such different environments are subjected to very a variety of interactions with their surroundings, sometimes triggering episodes of furious star formation or feeding their voracious central supermassive black holes.

This measurement reveals a surprisingly large amount of information about the object and conditions that created the light, and about the medium that the light traveled through before reaching the instrument. There are numerous methods used for spectrometry, and numerous important findings resulting from it, including the expansion (and acceleration) of the universe, the chemical composition of stars and nebulae, discovery of new elements, characterization of planetary atmospheres, discovery of exoplanets, geology on Mars - the list goes on and on! In this lecture, we will look at the basics of light and the spectrum, at various techniques for measuring it, and at some of the more interesting pieces of information that can be obtained with spectrometric techniques.'

Only in the last decade have we really started to understand this enigmatic body. We have found that Titan represents, in several important ways, the most Earthlike environment in the Solar System after the Earth itself. These similarities, along with some striking differences, will be examined in this lecture.'

A paucity of large craters argues for a young surface and recent geological activity, and magnetometry confirms that a salty ocean persists today. Europa\'s ocean and surface are inherently linked. Tidal deformation of the floating ice shell generates stresses that fracture and deform the surface to create ridges and bands. Dark spots, domes, and chaos are probably related to tidally driven ice convection and partial melting. Europa\'s activity may permit the "ingredients" necessary for life to be present within the satellite\'s ocean. Astonishing geology and high astrobiological potential make Europa a top priority for future spacecraft exploration.'

The history of planetary astronomy encapsulates the scientific process: as we get new data, we have to revise how we think about things--and our place in the universe.

Yet, our technology is incredibly vulnerable to solar fury. Invisible clouds of ions float towards us, interacting with out magnetic field, and wrecking havoc on electronics. The radiation of a solar flare is capable of killing astronauts in an instant. On the ground, power grids and oil lines face degeneration and destruction when the Sun strikes. We\'re entering the next solar cycle, and unless we prepare for it, the Sun will annihilate our technology and livelihoods as it sees fit.'

Our modern minds, however, now know better, and we can enjoy the comets\' dazzling displays in the night sky--although if one were to ever impact us, it could actually bring doom.

In fact, the whole process is a good example of science in action, where old theories need to be altered (sometimes with controversy) as new empirical data come in. In order to understand the background of the International Astronomical Union\'s decision process for Pluto, we will look at the history of planetary discovery from William Herschel\'s 1781 finding of Uranus onwards. (And if we somehow have clear skies, after the talk we\'ll try to observe some of the suspects involved: Uranus, Neptune, and Ceres.)'

(Walking the entire 1.2 km out to the Pluto stele and visiting the Sciencecenter would also be a good thing!) We will run some numbers --anonymously!!!-- vis-a-vis various distances to see how long it would take us to actually get anywhere in the universe.

According to the president of the club Lou Yurek \'75, in addition to inviting guest speakers the club is planning other activities including a field trip to the Danby Radio Telescope and amateur telescope making class. "Although we only get an average of one good observing day every two weeks, the club meets every Friday night, clear sky or no," said Kathy Hodges \'75, CAS secretary.'

The different comets which have appeared since early in the last century were discussed as to their orbits, shapes and future returns. Professor Boothroyd then explained the construction of the great telescope used at the Mount Wilson Observatory, the finest plant for astronomical purposes in the world.'

As the sky was not clear, it was impossible to observe the planets, but by means of lantern slides a general description of the planets and their orbits was presented. Probably the most interesting phase of the lecture to those not versed in the more mathematical problems of the planetary system was a discussion of the probability of higher life on Mars and Venus. A hypothesis of the existence of intelligent beings on Mars has been forwarded by Lowell, who studied that planet under the best conditions possible. The possibility of life on Venus [is] not nearly so probable as on Mars, despite recent newspaper articles to the contrary, as venus moves about the sun with one side always facing it, and as a result, one side must be very hot and the other an ice sheet. Thus the only portion that could even be imagined to support life is a narrow margin between the two expanses of desert and ice, and conditions there would not be likely to be favorable, due to extremes of hot and cold winds.'

If the sky is clear, the lecture will be illustrated by views of the moon, stars, planets and nebulae. A feature of especial interest will be an eclipse of the moon which begins at 9:27 o\'clock and lasts until 11:30 o\'clock. Should the weather permit, the moon will be shown through the telescope.
