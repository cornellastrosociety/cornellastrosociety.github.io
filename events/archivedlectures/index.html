                    The Fuertes Observatory will be open to the public from 10 PM on Thursday night, March 13th, until 6 AM on Friday morning, March 14th, for the observing of the upcoming total eclipse of the Moon. <b>The eclipse does not start until midnight</b>, but the building will be open for two hours prior. The eclipse occurs in several phases:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">11:57:28 PM: Start of penumbral eclipse.</span> The Moon becomes very slightly dimmer, as it is shadowed by Earth's penumbra.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">1:09 AM: Start of partial eclipse.</span> Earth's umbral shadow begins to be cast upon the Moon, significantly dimming a growing portion of the Moon.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">2:26 AM: Start of total eclipse.</span> The Moon is completely within Earth's umbral shadow, and begins to turn reddish.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">2:58:43 AM: Maximum eclipse.</span> The Moon is as centered as it will be within Earth's shadow.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">3:31 AM: End of total eclipse.</span> The Moon loses its red color and is again only partially eclipsed.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor">4:47 AM: End of partial eclipse.</span> The Moon no longer has an umbral shadow cast upon it, but is still shadowed by Earth's penumbra.</li>
                        <li><span class="timecolor phase_em">6:00:09 AM: End of penumbral eclipse.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>Unlike a solar eclipse, there is no danger to observing the moon during an eclipse without specialized equipment or filters, so one does not need any sort of eclipse glasses to view this event. Observation of the eclipse is dependent on the weather; if the skies are overcast and the moon cannot be seen, then the eclipse will not be visible either. Comprehensive plots regarding the weather at Fuertes and the surrounding area, including cloud cover, can be found on our <a href="/visit/weather">Weather page</a>.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>The eclipse can be observed from anywhere in North or South America – not just from the observatory. Visitors to Fuertes between midnight and 6 AM will be able to observe the eclipse from our observation deck, or through our telescopes, including the historic 12-inch Irving Porter Church refractor. Volunteers from the Cornell Astronomical Society will guide visitors through viewing and provide information about the event.</div>
