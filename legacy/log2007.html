<h2>What we saw</h2>

<p>This page will be updated frequently as we hold observing sessions. Editor's note: All
observations prior to April, 2008, were made through the 12" refractor unless
otherwise specified. In April, 2008, CAS acquired a 10"-aperture Dobsonian with computer
"push-to" control through SAFC funding. This allows us to have a portable telescope
to take to school outreach events and on other club trips. To differentiate observations
made with it versus the classic 12" refractor, we named it "Bob the Dob."
Several members had already taken informally to referring to the main telescope as "Irv,"
since its official title is the Irving Church Porter telescope, after its donor. Thus,
most log entries from April 2008 onwards refer to "Bob" and "Irv."

<h3>Wednesday, August 6, 2008</h3>

<p>
Shianne came by "to do a bit of dancing and some Perseid previewing," and saw one fireball
through a thin layer of clouds.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, August 4, 2008</h3>

<p>
Shianne wandered up on a "glorious night" to find a group of pre-frosh sitting by the
door, so she let them in and showed them Jupiter&mdash;"they all enthusiastically
concluded that they'd simply have to join the astro club."
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 25, 2008</h3>

<p>
We began before sunset with some training for several members of Julia's class
who'd expressed much interest in joining CAS. A large steady crowd of about 100
visitors; quieted down after 2230. Bob was on Jupiter the entire evening. In Irv we
got M57, &epsilon;-Lyr., M28, and, after much travail, Neptune.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 18, 2008</h3>

<p>
A hot steamy (i.e., high-humidity!!) night of observing. Clouds prevented the normal 9pm
opening, but Mike, passing by about 10pm, noticed three different small groups of guests
converging on the observatory. Since clouds were parting, he decided to open despite the
sweltering heat and obscuring haze, and showed the Moon and Jupiter to about 15 visitors.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 14, 2008</h3>

<p>
A second lab night for Julia's intro Astro class. Mostly different but again
extremely enthusiastic students with very intelligent questions.:) Lots of Moon,
a bunch of Jupiter; a few other usual suspects (&epsilon;-Lyr., Ring, M13, Albireo)
in binocs/Bob. Four of Julia's students got gung-ho enough to want to join CAS.:)
One, Lyndsey, even stayed afterwards to get initial training: she found Jupiter and
then the Whirlpool and its buddy galaxy&mdash;woo-hoo!:)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 11, 2008</h3>

<p>
Clouds put a damper on the night, but Danny stuck around to give a visitor a view
of the Moon. A trickle of other single or small groups of visitors then happened, so
he gave them sky tours plus peeks at Jupiter and the Moon. Hazehazehaze prevented
anything except those two objects and the brightest stars from being visible, but
when the Ring Nebula was at the zenith he tried and got it, although at the price of
an aching neck. Earlier, Lisa passed her keyholder test.:)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, July 7, 2008</h3>

<p>
An old friend (Class of '76, who'd never been to Fuertes as a student) was in town
so Art showed him the Double-Double, Albireo, M57, and Jupiter + 3 moons.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, July 5, 2008</h3>

<p>
Shianne and Lisa had "a rather large and exuberant group come tonight in hopes of
experiencing a mystical journey through the night sky." They showed them the Moon,
Saturn, Jupiter, the Rocking Horse Cluster (NGC 6910), and "a presently nameless (at
least to us) star cluster in Cygnus." Shianne also directed Lisa to find the Blinking
Nebula (she did, eventually :) as preparation for her key test.
<br /><br />
(Ed.'s note: Danny and Art meanwhile had taken Bob the Dob down to Cherry Springs State Park,
the dark-sky park in north central Pennsylvania. While not an offical entry since it was not
at Fuertes, they both were utterly blown away by what the night sky is <i><u>really</u></i> like and how
much of our heritage has been lost due to light pollution&mdash;while they could not actually tell
if they were casting shadows by the light of the Milky Way, they could easily read the CAS logo
on Art's t-shirt; and when, while getting some things for a few people sitting on the grass
nearby, Art went to focus Jupiter, he pulled back cursing in pain from how bright it was! They
only stayed until a little before 2am; but both agreed this would count as one of the top ten
events of their lives, and vowed to get more CASers down for a full all-nighter.)
</p>



<hr />

<h3>Friday, July 4, 2008</h3>

<p>
It looked iffy at first but cleared up; about 60 visitors, including 40+ high school
students. We saw the 1-day old Moon, M13, M57, Jupiter, &epsilon;-Lyrae; in binocs,
we also got the Coathanger asterism, M8, and M20. Lisa found the Rocking Horse
cluster "by the scenic route" as star-hopping practice; Danny got the Ring Nebula,
having figured out his prior problems (had started from the wrong star&mdash;ooops!).
After midnight, Art and Danny found M71 and M27, then Art left and Danny got Ms 29,
31, and 32 in Irv as well as wandering around the sky with binocs, seeing the
Double Cluster and possibly the large and diffuse maybe-cluster Do43 in Cygnus.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, July 2, 2008</h3>

<p>
In Bob, Danny and Art got Saturn, Mars, and Ms 4/8/57 in an attempt to figure out
how to get the alignment to work; repeated attempts to find M81/82 failed. In Irv
they got M3 and did Jupiter with a green filter. After Art was replaced by Mike,
Danny checked out Jupiter in other filters for comparison. Haze made viewing poor:
&epsilon;-Lyr. was just a pair of oblong stars, and the open cluster Ste1 seemed to
have fewer visible stars than before.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, July 1, 2008</h3>

<p>
Danny and Art helped Julia Kregenow's Astro 105-107 lab see stuff: a <b><i>REALLY</i></b>
fun group of students!!:) A good clear night, resulting in more things found than they
could remember to write down. Things they <i>could</i> remember included Saturn, Mars,
Jupiter, Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyr., the Rocking Horse Cluster, Ms 13, 4, 28, 8, 20, 24,
23, 6, 7, and 57, and A Number Of Fine Meteors&trade;.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 27, 2008</h3>

<p>
A mostly cloudy Friday open house. A group from Balch stopped by only to find most
of the sky obscured by cirrus; most gave up and left, but skies eventually cleared
enough to see M57, M13, Jupiter, &epsilon;-Lyr., Albireo, and Saturn.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, June 24, 2008</h3>

<p>
A clear moonless night with comfortable temperatures allowed Art to play with the Dob
(M3, M13, M57, M6, M8, IC 4665), Danny to observe with the refractor (Jupiter, M57,
open cluster Ste1), and Mike to provide a constellation tour to some guests, all under
the watchful eye of Shianne.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 20, 2008</h3>

<p>
Summer solstice, and the clouds left an hour before sunset. Art had Saturn dialed
in before sunset, but nobody came by before it had moved into the dome dead spot,
so got it in Bob instead&mdash;could just see Titan with the 18mm. Haze and rising
fog forced Shianne and him to take Bob and the binocs in due to moisture. In Irv they
failed to get M4 but did get M13, &epsilon;-Lyr., M57, Albireo, Jupiter + 3 moons,
and the Moon in the 40mm wide-angle. About 25 visitors over the evening, ending with
3 Sagan Appreciation Society people who stayed until well after midnight.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, June 16, 2008</h3>

<p>
On Shianne's brother's last evening visiting, the clouds parted just long enough
for her to show him Saturn and the Moon.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, June 15, 2008</h3>

<p>
Shianne's brother had been visiting for a couple of days... which of course were
entirely cloudy at night.:( Bringing him up during the day while she did a photography-class
project, they did some solar observing; they saw a few prominences but didn't look
for sunspots.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, June 11, 2008</h3>

<p>
A special opening for a group of about 20 people here for a computer security
conference. In Irv we got them the Moon, Saturn + 4 moons, M65 (barely visible due to
moon pollution), and &epsilon;-Lyr.; in Bob, Albireo, M3, and M57; and M13 in binocs.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, June 8, 2008</h3>

<p>
Art opened briefly in response to a special request. He showed the two people Saturn,
the Moon, and M104 before clouds took over; two others stopped by during it.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, June 7, 2008</h3>

<p>
The gypsy moth caterpillars appear to be running out of reinforcements: less than 20
tonight... Thin high clouds that got worse, although there was one good gap early on.
We got the Moon, Mars briefly, Saturn a bit, and a very faint M3 for about 3 minutes.
Very quiet night, about two dozen visitors (although as we were closing another dozen
kept dribbling through&mdash;they got cloudy night tours).
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 6, 2008</h3>

<p>
The Siege of Minas Fuertes continues, although no sign yet that the gypsy moth caterpillars are
bringing up Grond... Much more disturbing was a new dead spot in the dome in the southwest;
it may be heat-related, as we were able to move it again near sunset. Not a huge crush
of visitors: 100-150 range. We started with Irv on Saturn/Bob on the Moon; later targets
in various viewing instruments included M65 &amp; M66, M3, M57, M13, M81 &amp; 82, Jupiter,
Saturn, open cluster IC 4665, and &epsilon;-Lyr. Even with high humidity, the sky
was magnificently calm: tonight was the best viewing Art and Mike could ever remember
for &epsilon;-Lyr.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, June 5, 2008</h3>

<p>
Art arrived about 8:20pm for the first of three Reunion Weekend open houses to find
to his horror the observatory under attack by about 100 gypsy moth caterpillars: Yccccch!!!!
Clouds, but still about 20 visitors trickling through. At sunset someone pointed out
the new crescent Moon visible through a break, and he frantically set up Bob&mdash;so
about 8 people got to see the Moon a few seconds each...
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 30, 2008</h3>

<p>
A cloudy night, but having come in to look for a manual Shianne wound
up having well over an hour's conversation with "a very happy, enthusiastic
family." ("It makes me wonder how many interesting people we miss when
we don't open on cloudy Fridays.")
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, May 28, 2008</h3>

<p>
Mike had returned from a multi-week trip that included a visit to Mauna Kea
(he noted, "what a profoundly monumental experience it was to view the
stars from above the clouds, while inhaling oxygen with telescope operators,
on the summit of this revered dormant volcano."), so came by "on this clear,
moonless night for just a little casual, low altitude observing." He got Saturn
and Ms 57, 81, 82, 13, and 53 for a few guests. Bernadette and Pon were also in
attendance.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 27, 2008</h3>

<p>Clouds cleared at sunset so Art came to look for some things in Corvus
and Coma Berenices that he'd not gotten to last spring. In the 40mm wide,
NGC 4361, a planetary nebula, was about like the Crab or a little brighter;
failed on the Antennae galaxies (NGCs 4038/39) and NGC 3887 (in Crater).
He did not get to anything in Coma, but did get a couple of "off-the-path" (i.e.,
away from the clump of Messiers) galaxies in Virgo: starting with the
Sombrero, he found NGCs 4699, 4697 (better than some of the Virgo
Messiers!), 4753, and 4636. Clouds were moving in at midnight, so he ended
with the Whirlpool and pal&mdash;tonight the spiral structure of the
Whirlpool was at the extreme limits of visibility with most North Campus
lights off. Mars and M44 are still visible in the same field of view in
binoculars.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, May 25, 2008</h3>

<p>Final graduation weekend viewing; but <b><i>much</i></b> more
importantly, the successful touchdown of the Mars Phoenix Lander!! The
Astronomy Dept. held an open house to watch NASA-TV coverage, with an
overflow crowd of 160 according to the Cornell Chronicle story; Art left
immediately after touchdown, but by the time he walked back to Fuertes
and dialed in Saturn before sunset, there were already 12 people waiting! A
much mellower night, though, despite a steady stream of visitors (ca. 100
total). Saturn again had a cute moon configuration, with a triangle of moons
right next to it, on the same side as Titan; tonight he was able to switch
to M56/M66 mid-evening, though. By the end of the evening it had hazed
up, but he got M3 for the last few visitors. Out on the deck,
Shianne, Pon, and Stephen (who the next day declared to the email list that
this had been "the most awesome birthday ever!") got Mars/Beehive,
Saturn, and M57 in Bob the Dob. Stephen also hooked up a laptop with wireless
connectivity to the projector in the classroom so as to display the first Phoenix
raw images as displayed on the NASA website.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, May 24, 2008</h3>

<p>
Second graduation weekend viewing night and it was Sardine City&trade;,
with over 300 visitors&mdash;Shianne noted, "We had a deck full of visitors
before it even got dark!" She and Brandon manned Bob the Dob out on the
deck (assisted for a while by Pon), getting Saturn, M13, M81/82, M57, the
Blinking Nebula, and two passes of the International Space Station. Art
meanwhile had Saturn dialed in before sunset and was inside doing crowd
control all night long. Could not get off Saturn until 2330 because of the
continuously replenished wall-to-wall crowd wanting to see it. (Titan was
at about 4:30 relative to the planet, with three other moons directly opposite
and right next to the planet in a tight almost straight line.) We finally got to
move to M65/66 for the last 45 minutes. After the last customers left at 0026,
Art stayed for sundry practicing: in Bob, M13, M4, M57, and
&epsilon;-Lyrae; in Irv, M3; and in binoculars, Albireo, Jupiter (no moons
visible), and was just barely able to make out M8+M20 together.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 23, 2008</h3>

<p>
First of three consecutive viewing nights for Cornell graduation weekend. It
initially looked like it would be a fantastic night; but the [expletive deleted]
wind turned out to be from the <b><i>north</i></b> tonight, not the west,
so it clouded over soon after sunset. About 60 visitors trickled through,
nonetheless; the first few of them got to see Saturn and three moons, then
during a few-minute break later on some others got to see it again. (Seeing
<i>would</i> have been great; there was no blur at all to it!) The most
frustrating thing was getting only a five-second glimpse of Mars directly in
front of the Beehive Cluster in binoculars!! We finally closed for good at 2300.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 20, 2008</h3>

<p>
It having cleared by sunset, Art came to bag a few galaxies before moonrise.
After using Saturn for focusing/atmospheric check (good calm air, four
moons), he got NGCs 2903 (just west of Leo's nose), 4565 (the Needle), 4494
(cute little galaxy en route to 4565), the Sombrero, the Whirlpool + its buddy
5195 (had to dial them in since they were essentially overhead&mdash;spiral
structure not visible despite most North Campus lights being off, since the
Moon had risen by then), and quickly dialed in M87 to finish off. Closed at
2240.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, May 19, 2008</h3>

<p>
Shianne decided that such a clear night could not be wasted for mere sleep, so
came by. Saturn had four moons visible and "an unusual atmospheric band
that appears a bit darker&mdash;more orangish&mdash;than the rest of the
yellowish atmosphere." She attempted various Leo galaxies, to be foiled by a
full moon, but found the open cluster Do43, M29, and the Blinking Nebula,
NGC 6826.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, May 13, 2008</h3>

<p>
A training night. After using Saturn for focusing, Steve got M3, then Danny
attempted NGC 5466 but it was not visible. Russell W. then refound M3.
Danny got Mars, the Moon, M81/M82, and Albireo in Bob the Dob, and got
the Starlocator for Bob to work; Steve also figured out how to point Bob
correctly.:-) Some guests who came by got to see Saturn in Irv; Steve got M87,
then he and Art attempted to get Polaris, but something wasn't working
right.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, May 10, 2008</h3>

<p>
Special open viewing night for Astronomy Day. Mercury was seen just after
sunset, then there was much Moon and Saturn (five, possibly six moons
visible). Also seen were Mars, M53, M65, and M66. Another slow and steady
stream of about 40 visitors. Hazed over after 11pm, but not before Bari (who
after almost a year in the club had not found anything yet!) was trained and
found Saturn to the applause of her friends.:-)
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, May 9, 2008</h3>

<p>
The clouds (amazingly) stayed away, allowing a slow but steady stream of
visitors (40+) to see things. Bob the Dob and the industrial binoculars were
out on the deck, with Bob initially pointed at the Moon (an 18mm eyepiece
is a very good one to use for the Moon with Bob!), while Irv, the main
scope, began on Saturn. Over the course of the evening, Mars, M44, M13,
Albireo, &epsilon;-Lyrae, and the Coma Berenices open cluster (Melotte 113)
were found in various fields of view. Alex found M65 and M104; and at the
end Mike got NGC 5248 (galaxy in Bo&ouml;tes).
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, May 4, 2008</h3>

<p>
After an early evening meeting to hold CAS elections, multiple attempts
were made to image objects with our new Orion Space Imager CCD camera.
All, alas, failed. (Although an attempt to image a star resulted in a rare
capture of the "Einstein Sausage!") Danny and Stephen did manage to get
M58, M59, M60, and M13 for eye-viewing, though, and a number of
Eta&ndash;Aquarid meteors were witnessed on this very cold night.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, April 22, 2008</h3>

<p>While Shianne did homework downstairs, Danny again found the Virgo galaxies M58-59-60.
 Hazier than last time, so harder to see. (He wrote that he had also seen M97, the Owl
 Nebula; but since that is almost impossible to see from Fuertes under the best of
 conditions, it was highly unlikely; he agreed in later discussion that it may well have
 been wishful thinking.&mdash;Ed.) There was a
 peek at Saturn as it was clouding up.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, April 18, 2008</h3>

<p>Lisa and Brian gave a lecture on planetary weather on a beautiful spring evening.
 Guests started arriving already at 7:30, before sunset. Many happy guests were
 entertained with views of Saturn, Mars, and the Moon. Bob the Dob was set up on
 the deck, but "[we] couldn't find many deep-sky objects with it." A number of topics
 were debated, including "intelligent" design, determinism, and "lots of random
 weird stuff."</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, April 17, 2008</h3>

<p>Art came in briefly to debug the sidereal time display (the "On" and "Hold"
 labels on the toggle are backwards, *sigh*...). He found a family group of six and an
 Astro TA present, so showed them Saturn, the Moon, and gave them the nickel
 sky tour.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, April 16, 2008</h3>

<p>There was a visit by a loud but very enthusiastic group of 50+ 7th graders
 from the Chapin School, a private NYC girl's school. Art showed them Saturn (to the
 inevitable exclamations of "It looks like a picture!"), the Orion Nebula, and the Moon.
 Much moon pollution, but good steady viewing: the Cassini Gap was plainly
 visible. Titan and three other moons were also visible. Art turned things over to
 Danny, who also looked at Saturn and the Moon. Equipment problems continue
 to annoy: the RA calibration disk does indeed stick at several points, there was a problem
 with the sidereal time display, and the screws holding the RA locking knob snapped
 on Danny.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, April 8, 2008</h3>

<p>Steve learned the basics of telescope operation from Pon and found, among
 other things, M13 and Saturn, after an Astro 102/104 lab finished.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, April 2, 2008</h3>

<p>A good clear night; no haze or wind. Art found NGCs 2141 (open cluster near Betelgeuse),
 2169 (the "37" cluster), 2264 (the Xmas Tree cluster), a very iffy find of 2194 (another
 open cluster near 2169), 2775 (faint galaxy in Cancer on the border of Hydra), M35 and its <i>very</i>
 faint neighbor NGC 2158, found that open cluster Cr89 was too big for the wide
 angle, and open cluster Cr97 was basically a couple of stars. Danny came and found
 NGC 2244 (Rosette Nebula cluster), then got M104 and the Leo galaxy
 NGC 2903. Mike meanwhile had gotten the club's new Dobsonian scope working,
 and it was christened by all three with a look at the Orion Nebula out on the lawn.
 After Art left, Danny found Virgo galaxies M58-59-60, while Mike tested the
 electronic navigating/locating system on the Dob&mdash;worked fairly okay, but
 needs better alignment, since while it found Saturn easily, it needed help finding
 M13 and M81/82. ("The wide field view of M81/82 was very nice!") Danny also
 passed his keyholder test.:-)</p>

<p>(Editor's note: on the club email list the following week, the new Dob was
 christened in the other sense of the word. The main scope being 
 of late informally referred to as "Irv," the
 new scope, on Shianne's suggestion, is now "Bob the Dob.":-) No consensus has
 as of this writing been reached on a nickname for the Celestron.)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, March 29, 2008</h3>

<p>Art made a final attempt to do a Messier marathon. Due to equipment problems that cost
 much time and ability to find targets near the North Pole, he finally conceded defeat
 just after 0230, having logged 44 Messier objects plus 11 others. Details are available
 on the <a href="messier08.html">Messier marathon page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, March 24, 2008</h3>

<p>Noticing that it had cleared at sunset for once, instead of the other way around, Art
 came by to attempt as much of a Messier marathon as possible before moonrise. He found
 an Astro 102 lab just starting, vetoing the idea. He stayed to assist the TA, showing
 Saturn, M65/66, and M42/43 in the telescope, plus M45 in binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, March 23, 2008</h3>

<p>A gamma-ray burst event (GRB080319B) had been recorded on March 19th (one
of five(!) on the day of Sir Arthur C. Clarke's death)
 that was so powerful
 that an afterglow object was, according to news stories, visible to the naked-eye (from
 an estimated distance of 7.5 billion (yes, with a <b>B</b>!) light years). Art came by during the day to
 check which sky-chart to use in finding it and did some quick solar observing. One tiny
 (i.e., about the size of the Earth or a bit larger) sunspot was on the eastern limb just
 north of the solar equator, with an obvious and much larger bright area nearby; only one
 prominence of note was visible, also on the southeastern limb.
<br /><br />
In the evening, Art came back to look for the GRB afterglow object. He might have seen it:
 there were any number of faint points of light at the limits of visibility in the area,
 but he couldn't match up the view with pictures from the web. He consoled himself with
 logging some galaxies before the moon got too high: Ms 81, 82, 95, 96, 105, 65, 66, 51,
 and NGCs 5195 (Whirlpool companion), 3384, 3628, 4565 (Needle galaxy), and a very iffy
 4559. Good clear sky, no haze of note; closed at 2300.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, March 22, 2008</h3>

<p>Shianne came by and saw the Double Cluster and another Perseus open cluster, Tr2. She tried
 to find M76 but failed. The sky was a little hazy.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, March 21, 2008</h3>

<p>The sky was very hazy and a full moon washed out most targets. In addition, power to some
 parts of the building was out, leaving the entrance and hall in darkness, and confining
 music for J. S. Bach's 323rd birthday to the downstairs classroom. About 20 visitors came by, a
 decent turnout for Cornell's spring break. Art opened; Shianne, Mike, Pon, and Dounan (briefly)
 came by sometime later. We were able to show them M81 in the early evening
 (M82 was not visible&mdash;usually it's brighter, being edge-on) and M42 later on, plus Mars,
 Saturn, and the Moon, with M45 in the binoculars. The R.A. locking knob has finally been
 repaired.</p>

<hr />

<a name="Mess_try1"></a>
<h3>Sunday, March 9, 2008</h3>

<p>Mike and Art attempted to do a Messier marathon despite the lack of an R.A. knob (via joint
 operation of the 'scope: see prior entry). The evening began all right but clouds moved in
 by 2200. Only 28 objects,
 including non-Messiers, were found: by eye, M45; by binocs, Ms 103, 34, 42, 41, 47, 46, 93,
 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, plus NGCs 864/889, 957 (another open cluster right nearby), and Stock
 23 (open cluster near Perseus' head); in the 'scope, Ms 77, 31/32, 76, and NGCs 7662 (Blue
 Snowball), 7789 (big open cluster in Cassiopeia), and 1973-75-81, the rest of Orion's
 sword. The Astro Dept. had scheduled a student service organization event for that night,
 and about 20 people filled the downstairs. We gave them the cloudy-night tour and closed.
 (Of course, by the time Art had finished the log entry after closing, the sky had cleared
 again... Too tired and disappointed to try to resume.)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, March 5, 2008</h3>

<p>Shianne and Danny came by on a beautiful night with "delightfully crunchy snow" and only a
 very few clouds and little haze, to try some astrophotography. While they successfully
 downloaded the software to her laptop, they had little luck imaging Saturn or the Orion
 Nebula. The R.A. locking knob has now been removed entirely, so that it really needs two
 people to operate the telescope smoothly: one pans in R.A. using the
 <a href="/CAS/ptour/bb5.html">"ship's helm"</a> and
 the other stays at the eyepiece and pans in Decl.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, March 3, 2008</h3>

<p>A very warm and somewhat clear night. Shianne, Danny, and a Russell viewed the
 Orion Nebula and M41, but failed to find other nearby open clusters as the haze and then
 clouds grew worse. (One of the observatory's original purposes being the teaching of
 naval navigation, they then honored said traditional purpose via some ballistics
 practice, i.e., throwing snowballs off the roof.:-)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, February 28, 2008</h3>

<p>Art came in to practice M77 one more time, and figured out why he'd had problems the previous
 time around. He also did a fast practice of M78 and NGC 404 again. Lots of haze&mdash;M77 and
 NGC 404 were barely visible. Also, the R.A. locking knob is practically falling off and needs
 serious repair.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, February 24, 2008</h3>

<p>Art came in at sunset to practice various early-evening Messier objects and some alternates
 for the things that are too faint to get (Ms 74, 33, 110). Mike arrived soon thereafter.
 Practiced on the winter binocular-class open clusters Ms 41, 44, 46, 47, 35, 34, 36, 37,
 38, 93, and St23; in the 'scope Mike got M77 after Art had some problems, then got the
 galaxy NGC 404 (in the same wide-angle field of view as &beta;-And.). Art then got the
 Blue Snowball Nebula, NGC 7789 (Cassiopeia open cluster, huge and rich but all very, very
 faint stars&mdash;easy to miss), M34, NGC 1023 (galaxy a little ways almost due south of
 M34), and Ms 76, 108, 97, 109, 81, and 82. Meanwhile, the two Russells had arrived, and
 they and Mike went downstairs to try and load software for the new imager, and failed due
 to a lack of proper device drivers. Art left at 2150, leaving Mike and &alpha;-Russellorum
 to find Saturn.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, February 23, 2008</h3>

<p>Shianne came in and practiced a bit with calibrating the R.A. wheel and dialing in coordinates,
 not looking for particular things.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, February 20, 2008</h3>

<p>A midweek public viewing night for the total lunar eclipse, the last one visible from Ithaca
 until 21 Dec., 2010. A very cold and mostly clear night provided a flawless view of totality.
 Several hundred visitors enjoyed a "standard, beautiful eclipse," with the usual deep red
 and hints of turquoise. Shianne, Kim, Pon, Danny, Lisa, both Russells, Art, Mike, Hong Yu,
 Brian, Alex, Brandon, and Anthony were kept busy helping.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, February 16, 2008</h3>

<p>An extraordinarily clear blue day that gave way to a spectacularly (mostly--this <i>is</i> Ithaca!)
 clear night: Shianne, Lisa, Danny, and a Russell came by. Lisa found M41 and the Orion Nebula;
 Danny found "an open cluster north of Orion."
 Shianne found the Beehive Cluster (M44). Saturn and the Moon were also viewed. Mike and some
 friends stopped by in late evening, and the night ended with "a slight linguistic debate that
 included cheese and aluminum."</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, February 15, 2008</h3>

<p>We had a lecture by Jimmy and Dorothy on the death of stars, to a comfortably small audience
 (club members Kim, Elise, Shianne, Lisa, Russell R., Alex, Danny); the evening was
 thoroughly snowy and cloudy, so no observing. Instead, there was some archival work done
 on sundry folded documents written in German found in a desk drawer in the museum room. These
 looked like H-R diagrams (stellar evolution charts) but turned out to show data relating
 to water-height and a dam...</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, February 11, 2008</h3>

<p>Art came by to practice the Ursa Major Messier objects, only to find that the new regulator
 on the dome motor had been reset and needed a password in order to work again; thus, a
 beautiful night was wasted. Shianne arrived just as he was leaving, but she
 did not know how to get the regulator working again.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, January 30, 2008</h3>

<p>Clear but <b><i>frigid</i></b>, with a killing wind. Art opened at 1800 for new member
 training; Pon had seven students over for an Astro 102 lab. Before the lab section came
 by, Art looked at Castor: the two primaries were visible and very tight. He
 also saw NGC 2331, a loose, faint open cluster, and
 the Xmas Tree Cluster, NGC 2264. Danny found M31/32 for Pon's students, then the Orion
 Nebula and the other sword components (NGCs 1973-75-81). Mars was observed, though
 no details were visible; and we had the term's first look at Saturn. Much atmospheric
 turbulence. Art also trained Danny on the winter binoculars-class Messier objects (both
 lying on the deck to keep out of the wind as much as possible...).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, January 28, 2008</h3>

<p>Art was by from 1900-2230. Much haze at lower altitudes, but things got better during the
 course of the evening. The passing near-Earth asteroid 2007TU24 was too faint to see at
 Fuertes (ca. magn. 11.5), but he got A Pile O' Stuff&trade;: M77, NGC 752 (big open cluster),
 M33 (!-barely discernible as a dim glow filling the field of view in the 40mm wide-angle),
 M31/32 (M31 much fainter than usual), a very iffy possible sighting of M110, M103, NGCs
 659 and 663 (tiny open clusters near M103), the Owl Cluster (NGC 457), the Crab (quite faint), each
 half of the Double Cluster, M79, M35 and its tiny, faint companion NGC 2158, a possible
 sighting of the open cluster DoDz4 (so loose and few stars that it was hard to tell if it was the
 cluster or background), NGC 2169 (the "37" Cluster), the Xmas Tree Cluster (NGC 2264),
 and NGC 2244 (open cluster, part of the Rosette Nebula). He also passed by &lambda;-Ori., a very nice,
 bright, tight double star.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 25, 2008</h3>

<p>The dome motor is finally fixed, with a new regulator! (It spins the motor up slowly, which
 reduces strain on the circuit breaker: no more loud BANG to startle visitors when we have
 to move the dome.) After the start-of-term business meeting with 15 members in attendance
 (discussing the lecture series,
 outreach, and a design contest for new CAS t-shirts), we saw Mars and the Orion Nebula in
 Irv (the new nickname for the telescope, since its official name, engraved on a plaque on
 the mount, is the Irving Porter Church Telescope :-); Mercury was visible at dusk just above
 the horizon; and with binoculars got the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion Nebula, M41, and M44.
 Clouded over by 2230; Bernadette passed her keyholder test, closing by herself.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, January 18, 2008</h3>

<p>First official public viewing night of the spring term. Art arrived at 1800, seeing Mercury
 low in the SW from the parking lot; Danny, Shianne, Brandon, Kim, Lisa, and others showed up
 at varying times later. The Celestron could not be set up due to ice clogging
 the mounting holes; we need to find a solution for this. Binocular targets included Mira,
 M45, Mars, and M42&mdash;very bad moon pollution, with M31 invisible(!). When a larger crowd
 of visitors came by, we opened the dome slit where it stood and observed whatever passed
 by, including Mira, Mars, M42, M45, and the Moon. Quite an impressive collection considering
 the immovable dome slit!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, January 9, 2008</h3>

<p>A genuinely clear, moonless night, albeit with a chilling wind, allowed for some serious observing
 with the C-14. Mike and Art arrived after 6pm and observed till about 8pm. Targets included
 comets Holmes and 8-P-Tuttle (both faint binocular targets), Mars, M42/43, open cluster St23
 (much less interesting in a telescope, alas), NGC 2169 (the "37" Cluster), and an inadvertent
 stumble upon M35 while looking for the former. (The C-14 is very unwieldy, and its finder
 remains out of alignment&mdash;needs to be re-aligned during daytime at some point when it's
 not freezing out!) They also noticed that the variable star Mira was at its maximum apparent
 magnitude, ca. +2.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, January 7, 2008</h3>

<p>Art was by from 1815-1915. Being now equipped with correct coordinates,:-) he was able to find
 both Comets Tuttle and Holmes. Both are very faint hazes; Holmes was now about what the
 Crab Nebula looks like in the 40mm wide-angle, with Tuttle even fainter. There was <b><i>much</i></b>
 water haze, as it had gotten above 60 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. A spate of the
 usual binoculars suspects: Ms 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42/43, 45, 103, the Hyades, and the Double
 Cluster. Also, while getting to the Double, he was astounded to run into a completely
 different open cluster called St23, whose existence had been hitherto altogether unexpected by him: A
 Fine Little Object to remember for future public evenings.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, January 3, 2008</h3>

<p>A clear sky at sunset, so Art came by at 1830 to see if anyone else might arrive so as to set
 up the C-14. Got the usual suspects in binoculars to say he'd observed something: Mars, Hyades,
 the &alpha;-Perseus Group, Ms 45, 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 103, and the Double Cluster. He was
 unable to find Comet Tuttle, and Comet Holmes was invisible. There was a high ice haze moving
 in; Mike came by at 1930, but they didn't stay. At least the deck is now shoveled off.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, December 31, 2007</h3>

<p>The sky out at Art's place had cleared somewhat by 2300, so he decided a good way to spend
 midnight of New Year's Eve would be observing things at the obs. Alas, the Ithaca skies
 were much cloudier by the time he drove in&mdash;only a hazy look at Mars in the binocs
 was possible.</p>


<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, December 25, 2007</h3>

<p>A very peaceful Christmas night with a gorgeous sky, making it lamentable that
the dome motor remains broken. Shianne took a break from her polishing and
looked at the Moon, the Hyades, the Pleiades, and Mars in the binoculars, then lay
on the deck for a bit and saw two bright meteors. Art stopped by briefly for a binoculars
peek.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, December 23, 2007</h3>

<p>Shianne has been polishing the brass fixtures on the scope. Art stopped by as the
clouds were breaking up, but there was such massive moon pollution that most
binoculars targets were washed out: he managed M42, the Double Cluster, and M31
just barely. (Comet Holmes was invisible, and an alleged glimpse of M103 might
well have been wishful thinking.) However, there was a very tight conjunction of
the full Moon and Mars, less than a lunar diameter. After Art left, Mike arrived to
observe the conjunction as well. He and Shianne set up the Celestron to finally
observe Mars, which, just past opposition, was only about 55 million miles away
(the closest it will be for the next nine years). They also tested the new flip mirror,
observed the Moon and the Orion Nebula, and entertained one visitor&mdash;a
Cornell police officer. Overall it was a windy, relatively mild night and an
invigorating opportunity to finally do some observing, albeit between clouds.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, December 9, 2007</h3>

<p>Tonight stated out as a somewhat clear night, so Shianne and Danny opened.
After shoveling the deck, some minor observing was done: Mars, Pleiades, and
the Orion Nebula in binoculars. Jen arrived, and "a most unusual sled" was found
downstairs. Since it had clouded up again, there was only one thing to be done: go
sledding down the slope with stairs towards Appel Commons. The evening
concluded with research into the history of the "Shortnin' Bread" song.</p>

<hr />


<h3>Friday, November 23, 2007</h3>

<p>About 10 people stopped by at the beginning of the evening but there weren't
too many celestial wonders to show off tonight (due to the full Moon, dead dome
motor, and clouds). Shianne set up the big binoculars for them to look at the Moon.
Danny brought visiting relatives by, but it was clouded over at that point. The clouds
off the lake finally stopped around 9:45pm, but the Moon was blotting out most things.
Art showed six visitors the comet and pointed out stuff. We closed at 2215.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, November 10, 2007</h3>
 
<p>Clear skies at 8pm, so Art came to see Comet Holmes. He first checked on
Uranus to settle the dispute from Nov. 2nd, and found that his distinguished
colleagues Pon and Shianne had been correct that we had <i>not</i> seen
Uranus last week; he stands duly abashed and chastised. Comet Holmes now takes
up an entire quadrant of the finder scope, and about 60-65% of the field of view of
the 40mm wide-angle. The northern edge is more well-defined while the southern
half sort of trails away. It has an oblong inner coma shape, with some small faint
blotch that appears to be the nucleus. An Astro 195 person came by to finish a lab
so Art gave her and her friend the nickel sky tour and showed them M31/32.
Brandon and Danny arrived so they did the comet again then Art showed Brandon
how to get Polaris, and left. The Russells, Mike, and Shianne arrived later to brave
the 20 degree Fahrenheit temperature. A few low clouds (or high fog, if you will)
passed throughout the night, but they weren't prevented from finding M1, M35,
NGC 2392, and Mars (with possible ice cap). On a more catastrophic note, as they
attempted to move the dome late in the night, they were horrified to hear wooden
teeth shooting out of the dome gear works. Evidently a gear, for some reason made
of wood, succumbed to age and the cold humid weather, and failed. The dome
cannot be returned to its standard position or anywhere else until the motor is
repaired.</p>


<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, November 7, 2007</h3>

<p>After a cloudy evening skies cleared late, providing the opportunity for some
 quality observing within days of the New Moon. Comet Holmes now shows a distinct
 direction to its motion, as the bright, primary coma is now clearly more diffuse
 and extended on one end. It has grown to take up more than half the field of view
 of the 40mm (at least 16 or 17 arc min.), though its ion tail is still only
 visible in long photographic exposures. The Orion Nebula and Crab Nebula were
 also quite impressive tonight, as was Mars. NGCs 1513 and 1245 (open clusters in
 Perseus) were also observed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, November 3, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike stopped by to check up on Comet Holmes. Variable skies with occasional clouds
 off the lake permitted decent observations of the continually expanding comet.
 About 15 arc minutes in size, Holmes is now too large to photograph with his camera's
 fixed field of view and completely fills that of the 26mm Pl&ouml;ssl eye piece.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, November 2, 2007</h3>

<p>Comet Holmes is still going strong! Jenn gave a much-anticipated lecture on the
 Big Bang to a full classroom. The lecture was immediately followed by observing!
 We saw mostly Comet Holmes through the main scope, although Alex did get a chance
 to train on M36 and Art may have found Uranus. We also had the Celestron set up out
 on the deck, through which we saw Mars, M31, M32, and the Ring Nebula. With the
 binoculars we found the open cluster in Taurus, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and many
 other sights. David found the Orion Nebula to conclude this exciting, beautiful
 night at the observatory.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, October 30, 2007</h3>

<p>Public opening night for Comet Holmes! We had a good turnout with a lot of
 enthusiastic guests. The comet could fit across the finder scope about six times.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, October 29, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim and Shianne came to view Comet Holmes, which is now so large that it
 appears through the finder scope how it used to appear through the main scope
 with a 26mm eyepiece. It can fit across the finder scope about eight times and
 across the main scope with the 40mm eyepiece about 5 times. The red filter
 made all the stars around it disappear and made it considerably dim. The green
 and yellow filters seemed to make it slightly larger. The other filters didn't
 do anything.
<br /><br />
Later Mike and Elise came by and, although they did not play with filters while
 looking at Comet Holmes, did have their hand at a bit of astrophotography.
 It was beginning to get chilly and cloudy, but overall a very nice night for
 observing (at least for Ithaca!)</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 28, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike, Art and Danny took another look at Comet Holmes. It was wider and many
 stars were visible through it. Mike took some images. We showed one Astro student
 the comet as well as M31 in binoculars. Danny got training on how annoying it is
 to see Polaris. Clouds shut us down just as Shianne arrived.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 26, 2007</h3>

<p>Jimmy Hartzell gave a lecture titled "Death of the Universe" to a moderate-sized
 audience on this rainy night.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, October 25, 2007</h3>

<p>Tonight Mike, Art, Kim, Shianne, Pon, and Brian K. viewed the remarkable Comet
 Holmes, which made for an amazing event when it brightened from magnitude 17 to
 magnitude ~2.5 over the course of a night. The sudden increase of over 600,000
 times in brightness made for the appearance of a new "star" in the constellation
 of Perseus. On the previous night, immediately following the presumed outgassing
 that resulted in the increased brightness, the comet appeared shockingly stellar
 to the naked eye, and nothing more than a fuzzy star through the telescope. Over
 the next night the coma increased to give an appearance resembling a planetary
 nebula.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, October 21, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike opened at dusk to view Comet Loneos, which at about +6 magnitude was visible
 in binoculars and easily found in the finder scope a few degrees south of Arcturus.
 It was distinctly green in color, but no tail was visible. A few cirrus clouds moved
 in at about 8pm, prompting him to close up shop. These same clouds produced a fine
 paraselene (moon dog) just as he left.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, October 20, 2007</h3>

<p>Mike, Danny, Shianne, Jenn, and Lisa came on a wonderfully clear autumn night,
 graced by the peak of the Orionids. We enjoyed several dozen meteors, including
 many bright ones, at a rate of about 20 meteors per hour.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 19, 2007</h3>

<p>The cloudy night tour preceded CAS's weekly lecture for once, as technological
 difficulties required that the lecture begin late. However, the patience of the
 audience paid off, and in due time Laura and Bari gave a spirited account of the
 science and allure of meteor showers.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 12, 2007</h3>

<p>Lisa and Brian gave a lecture on comets. It was mostly cloudy but miraculously
 cleared a little past 8pm. We found the Ring Nebula, M34, M13, and
 Albireo. Tried  to find the galaxy NGC 891 (a different, very faint galaxy in
 Andromeda) but without success. It was so clear we could see the
 Milky Way! It was quite cold, but after the crowds left we also viewed M39, Mars,
 and M1.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, October 5, 2007 </h3>

<p>Sam started the night with a nice lecture about Kepler and clear (though hazy)
 skies allowed public viewing to follow. We started with M13, then NGC 129 (open
 cluster in Cassiopeia). Danny
 found M31, Pon found M33, then Russell found M38. Mike found Mars, then an eager
 new member, Hong Yu, found it again.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, October 4, 2007</h3>

<p>Today is the 50th anniversary of the space age! A clear but hazy night. Art found
 Neptune, Russell got the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009), Danny got M72, Art got Uranus,
 and Danny got NGC 7331 (a galaxy in Pegasus, pretty good even with haze). Shianne
 took over at 10:20pm. Danny stuck around too and they found NGC 129 (Cassiopeia open
 cluster) and tried to
 find NGC 891 (faint galaxy in Andromeda) and M33 but could not for the haze.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 28, 2007</h3>

<p>Ken Ferguson gave an informal talk on Tycho Brahe to a not empty classroom. Rain,
 Thunder and Lightning prevented us from opening for public viewing to night.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, September 23, 2007</h3>

<p>Training for new folks; Doug and David on their first night found &beta;-Andromedae, the
 Owl Cluster (NGC 457), and M103. David got M103. Dan got M103, M31, M34, and &gamma;-Andromedae.
 Art did M32, M76, and showed three visitors on the lawn the nickel sky tour. Also saw M13, the Double
 Cluster (NGCs 864/889), and the Pleiades in binoculars. </p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 22, 2007</h3>

<p>Kim and Pon came to the observatory with Elise so that Elise could take her Key
 test. She found the Andromeda Galaxy. Everything went smoothly and she passed.
 Meanwhile, Pon set up the Celestron telescope out on the deck. Danny stopped by
 while Elise was testing and Shianne arrived shortly before Elise closed. 
<br /><br />
Shianne looked at M34 and M74; Sam Located M77 all by himself. On the deck we pointed
 out Camelopardalis and the Lynx to ourselves before ending the night with a view of
 the Crab Nebula and the waxing Mars (which we attempted to image).</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 21, 2007</h3>

<p>Tonight it was busy. We had Rob West give a lecture on planetary imaging as part
 of the CAS lecture series. It was a moderately popular lecture, filling the classroom
 with ~30 people. However, we also had the privilege of hosting a second lecture,
 given by Ryan Anderson, an astronomy grad student, in conjunction with a dorm group
 visit. Ryan discussed solar system exploration with the aid of a lot of pretty
 pictures. Public viewing followed: in addition to the normal public, we had a large
 (~40) group from Alice Cook House again, led by Prof. Phil Nicholson, for which we
 also set up the Celestron. Prof. Jean-Luc Margot also brought a small (~10) group of
 students. We showed them the moon, Jupiter, and the moon again (Sinus, Iridium,
 Copernicus, etc.), and finally Andromeda briefly before the sky clouded over.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Wednesday, September 19, 2007</h3>

<p>We came up at 10 pm and spent the duration of our stay looking for Neptune. Using
 coordinates a few days old, Elise, after getting lost but finding herself again,
 found Neptune! Mike also found Neptune of his own volition.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Monday, September 17, 2007</h3>

<p>Astro 103 Lab. Great night for observing! Pon saw Albireo, M31, the Ring Nebula M57,
 Jupiter, and the moon.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 14, 2007</h3>

<p>Sarah Morrison gave a lecture on Martian History to a comfortably full classroom
 of about 25. She was the first to use the new projector! She had fantastic false
 color images of Mars that almost made up for the stormy cloud cover. We gave guests
 the cloudy night tour but lightning's fast approach sent everyone hope early.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Thursday, September 13, 2007</h3>

<p>The night was really clear, so Pon decided to practice star hopping a bit. He
 found M51 and M92. As Pon was leaving, Art brought a friend from out of town in
 who'd never been to Fuertes while an undergrad. He showed her M13, M31, M32, the
 Owl Cluster, and the Double Cluster in the binoculars.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, September 9, 2007</h3>

<p>We had our bylaws meeting and updated the majority of CAS procedures. It has
 been rainy and foggy today and opening for tonight is doubtful.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, September 7, 2007</h3>

<p>Pon gave a fantastic lecture on Cosmology to a full (and warm) classroom of
 people. We found Jupiter for the crowd (including the residents of Alice Cook
 house, led by Prof. Phil Nicholson). We tried but failed to find the globular
 cluster M56, so then found M13 instead. The crowds died down, which allowed Russell
 to get some training, but it was too cloudy. It was a very full Friday, even
 though we closed early due to weather.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, September 2, 2007</h3>

<p>[Afternoon] We took preliminary inventory and also did some solar observing of
 some prominences which we showed to passing guests.<br /><br />

[Evening] Mike and Elise opened on the third consecutive clear night for a bit
 of observing. Mike located NGC 7009 (the Saturn Nebula), Neptune, M72, M73, M30,
 and may have been
 able to detect the faintest hint of NGC 7293, "the Helix," but was not convinced.
 Elise gained some experience by finding M2 without assistance.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, September 1, 2007</h3>

<p>Clear night, perfect for training eager new members. Trained on M4, Jupiter, the
 Owl Cluster, M13, and M57.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Friday, August 31, 2007</h3>

<p>Having for the most part recuperated from Tuesday's early morning adventure, last
 year's CAS members held the first general body meeting of the semester, and met the
 next generation CAS&mdash;a whole classroom full of them. ClubFest worked its magic once
 more: even more people showed up this year, than last. Public viewing night followed.
 It was very busy and crowded probably because the sky was beautifully clear and
 because Prof. Lloyd said he was going to send all of his Astro 101 students our way.
 We showed Jupiter, the Rocking Horse Cluster, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Ring Nebula,
 and the Moon (through bino-viewers) and then Lisa and Jenn practiced on Mars and M103.
 Eight and half hours is a long time, but well worth every minute!</p>

<hr />

<h3>Tuesday, August 28, 2007</h3>

<p>Lunar Eclipse observations: A clear cool night. Partial eclipse began around 4:50
 am with the total eclipse beginning at 5:50 am. The total Lunar Eclipse became
 partially obscured by sunrise and, being low on the horizon, made it so that we had
 to view off the curbside or at Appel's parking lot. Also saw some nice anti-crepuscular
 rays (thanks, Mike!) after the moon disappeared. We shall have to see if the moon
 comes back tonight.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Sunday, August 26, 2007 </h3>

<p>Fine night with mostly clear skies, save a few patches of altocumulus, just shy
 of the Full Moon. Viewed Jupiter (Which now falls below the tree line by 10:30 pm
 EDT), and then provided an amorous couple a view of the lunar terminator (Solar
 terminator on lunar surface?). We pointed out constellations to additional guests
 before focusing on open clusters NGC 7261, 7235, 7243, 7209, and 7789. Next we
 attempted, but failed, to see sb giant NGC 7640, and ended with NGC 7662, "The Blue
 Snowball."</p>

<hr />

<h3>Saturday, August 18, 2007</h3>

<p>We had a special request to open the observatory tonight from a visiting family.
 It was hazy and cloudy, though so we were hard-pressed to find something exciting
 in the scope. It cleared up for a bit around the summer triangle, enabling us to
 get Vega in the scope. We tried to get M57, the Ring Nebula, but haze triumphed
 before we could find it. Nonetheless, the family was very pleased with their visit.</p>
